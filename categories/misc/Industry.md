## Bookazines
Due to the sheer number of magazines being published in the late 2000s, Publishers realised they could collate all the material from their monthly magazines into yearly publication.
This resulted in a rather thick magazine with no advertisements about the size of a book but with the print quality of a magazine, hense the industry dubbed them **bookazines**.

We have an entire page dedicated to just Bookazines related to game developement and the technical creative industry as a whole here:
