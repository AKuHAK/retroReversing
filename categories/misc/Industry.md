# Life in The Games Industry
Have you ever wondered what it was like to be a developer in the games industry in the 80s/90s/00s? This page will try to collect all the information we know about to help paint a picture of what it must have been like.

## Life in Imagine & Ocean Software in 1984

**Commercial Breaks** was a 30 minute documentary series in the UK about buisnesses and one episode in particular from 1984 is of interest to this site, it was called "The Battle for Santaâ€™s Software". It followed two British software companies, Imagine software and Ocean, only one remained at the end of the show!

On the Imagine Software side Mark Butler was 23 when the documentary was filmed and it shows his extravegent lifestyle with his fast cars and sponsored motrobike teams. He had 70 people working for them in May 1984 and John Gibson was the only programmer over 30 (Known as Grandad).

The documentary starts with Imagine Software looking great and antisipating the next big game, but sadly ends with bankruptsy. This documentary is great for showing the uncertainty in the early games Industry, one minute you are on top and gone the next.

Fortunetly former programmers at Imagine Software went on to establish **Psygnosis**, known for the Psy-Q development SDKs.

On the other side was **Ocean Software** and David Ward who managed to survive the time it took to film the documentary and showed off some of their upcoming games for the festive period.

# Game Industry Materials

## Magazines
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/magazines" description="For more information on all the Game development magazines check out this post." %}

## Bookazines
Due to the sheer number of magazines being published in the late 2000s, Publishers realised they could collate all the material from their monthly magazines into yearly publication.
This resulted in a rather thick magazine with no advertisements about the size of a book but with the print quality of a magazine, hense the industry dubbed them **bookazines**.

We have an entire page dedicated to just Bookazines related to game developement and the technical creative industry as a whole here:
