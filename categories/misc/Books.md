One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the books that were available to developers at the time, both game-specific books, programming books and digital/creative books have a wealth of information.

As this is a site about retro games we are mainly aiming to add books that were released around the time of retro consoles **or** books about retro game development.

This page is split into the following categories:
* Books about Retro Game Development with Modern Tools
* Books published around the same time as retro games
