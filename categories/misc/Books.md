One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the books that were available to developers at the time, both game-specific books, programming books and digital/creative books have a wealth of information.

As this is a site about retro games we are mainly aiming to add books that were released around the time of retro consoles **or** books about retro game development.

This page is split into the following categories:
* Books about Retro Game Development with Modern Tools
* Books published around the same time as retro games

There were some excellent books released by **Waite Group Press** [^1] such as the **Black Art of Macintosh Game Programming** and the **OpenGL SuperBible** which were both cutting-edge at the time.

Also the author **Joe Gradecki** released two books this year in the **NetWarriors** series, one an update to his book last yeae but this time in C++ and the other a guide to online resources, which would be very interesting to read now-adays, although most links would now be long dead.

### 3D Games: Real-time Rendering and Software Technology
There were a few books on 3D game programming released in 2000, one of the best has to be **3D Games: Real-time Rendering and Software Technology**. Although not an easy read and fairly Maths heavy, it is very in-depth and shows some very advanced concepts, even shows SIMD assembly programming in the first chapter. 

The book is split up into 6 sections each with their own chapters:
* **Modeling and foundation maths** - This section deals with the basic mathematics required to handle objects in three-dimensional space and the theory of object representation.
* **Classical 3D graphics** - Although much of the material in this section has migrated onto hardware, it is still necessary to have an appreciation of what
the hardware does to be able to use it effectively.
* **Real-time rendering** - This section deals with the technology developed by the games industry and the virtual reality industry which enables complex scenes to be rendered, to a reasonably high quality, in real time on a low-cost graphics processor.
* **Control of objects** - Mainstream techniques used to control the movement of objects are described in this section. This ranges from simple low-level control through to behavioural animation using Al technology. Thematerial on Al is in the form of a debate concerning the potential use of the technology in the future.
* **2D technology** - A potentially important solution to the complexity problem in 3D graphics, in terms of both the creation cost and the rendering cost, is the use of image-based rendering techniques.
* **Software technology** - This section deals with the techniques needed to write a multi-player game using the currently popular first-person shooter genre as an example. We examine the software architecture of a games engine and look at the design of the engine. Finally a comprehensive reference manual for the engine is given.

Although part of the book is taken up by the Fly3D SDK reference which was also on the CD (pages 617-749), this might have been useful as a physical reference in the past but not useful nowadays. 

The Appendices have some tutorials for how to use the FlySDK including building levels with 3D Studio Max and exporting to the BSP format used by the engine. These appendices end with you having a controllable 3D model space ship driving around a map, they are the easiest to understand and the most enjoyable section of the book.

# Books about Retro Game Development with Modern Tools
We tend to only cover retro games on this site and although the term retro means different things to different people, we have decided not to list game development books from 2010 and beyond. However we would like to list books published after 2010 if they are about Retro Game Development, that is what this section is for.

Most of these books employ modern tools to create games for retro hardware such as the ZX Spectrum or Commodore 64 through emulators which is a lot more accessible than using hardware and software from the time period.

This section will cover:
* Retro Game Dev - Commodore 64
* ZX Spectrum Games Code Club: Twenty fun games to code and learn - 2015
* Code the Classics - 2019
* Modern MSX BASIC Game Development: Build retro games in MSX BASIC using modern tools - 2021
* Bare-Metal Amiga Programming: For OCS, ECS and AGA - 2021
* The Making of Prince of Persia - 2020
* The Making of Karateka - 2012
* You: A Novel - 2012 (Fiction)

# Game Programming Starter Kit
The Game Programming Starter Kit was software that was released in 6 different versions by 2 different publishers (Sams and then McMillan). It was one of the best ways for new developers to learn game development with industry standard technologies. It is one of the few products that could almost guarantee to put students on the right path for the games industry.

## Version 1.0
<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit1.0.jpg" />
The first version was released in 1994 by Andre LaMothe and published by Sams, it consisted of 2 CDs and a full 900 page physical copy of Teach Yourself Game Programming in 21 Days. Not only that but it contained the full retail version of Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0 along with the eBook version of Teach Yourself Visual C++ in 21 Days. 

It also claims to have a full 2D DOS game engine on the CDs but we don't know much information about it.

## Version 2.0
The Second version was released in 1997 by Macmillan Digital Publishing but I have never seen a copy to be able to detail what it contained and information online is severly lacking.

## Version 3.0
<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit3.0.jpg" />
The Third version was released in 1999 by Macmillan Digital Publishing and consisted of 3 CDs and the full physical copy of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages**! 
It also includes the DirectX 6.1 SDK and an SDK called **Genesis 3D** but only included the Introductory Edition of Visual C++ 6.0. 
Genesis 3D did come with its own level editor which supported Direct3D and 3Dfx Glide drivers.

This time it contained three ebooks on the Disks:
* C++ Unleashed
* Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 Days
* Using Visual C++ 6

## Version 4.0
<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit4.0.jpg" />
The Fourth version was released in 2000 by **Macmillan Software** and only consisted of 2 CDs this time. On those 2 CDs was the same Introductory Edition of Visual C++ 6.0 as the previous version and version 3.1 of the Genesis 3D SDK. The DirectX SDK was upated to version 7.0 and it came with a new 3D animation tool called **Shadow Realm Model Animator**.

This time it only contained two ebooks but they were arguably better for game development as it now includes DirectX:
* Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 Days
* Teach Yourself DirectX 7 in 24 Hours


The physical book that was included this time was the **Second** Edition of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages** by **Marc Saltzman** which is a really interesting book pulished by **BradyGames**.

## Version 5.0
<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit5.0.jpg" />
The Fifth version was released in 2001 by **Pearson Software** but we don't currently know what was on the CDs. We can presume it has Version 8 of DirectX and most likely the same Introductory Edition of Visual C++ 6.0 as the previous versions.

It also may have included software called **3D GameStudio Standard** version 5.12 but this is only confirmed by one source [^5].

We know that one of the eBooks included on the CDs was:
* Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus

We do know however that the physical book that was included this time was the **Third** Edition of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages** by **Marc Saltzman**. This books seems to be rather rare as I have never seen it for sale outside of this bundle.

## Version 6.0
The mythical sixth version may have released in 2002 but there is no photos of it existing at all online. One source claims it included **DarkBASIC SE** which is a large departure from the standard Visual C++ and DirectX of the previous versions.

Did it include a **Fourth** edition of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages**? Who Knows?
