One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the books that were available to developers at the time, both game-specific books, programming books and digital/creative books have a wealth of information.

As this is a site about retro games we are mainly aiming to add books that were released around the time of retro consoles **or** books about retro game development.

This page is split into the following categories:
* Books about Retro Game Development with Modern Tools
* Books published around the same time as retro games

# Books published around the same time as retro games

This section will cover books available at the time when retro games were being created, for added context this section is broken down by year. The list of books in this section is not an exhaustive list and mainly includes books that would have been notable at the time.

Some of the most note-worthy publishers for game development related books on this list are:
* **Charles River Media**
* **Premier Press**
* **Prima Tech** (later became Premier Press) [^2]
* **Sams.net**
* **Waite Group Press** [^1]
* **Wrox Press**

Some of the most prolific authors in the game development genre were:
* **Andre LaMothe** - Celebrated Author and became Editor for the entire Prima Tech/Premier Press Game Developmenr Book Series
* **Jonathan S. Harbour** - Wrote over 20 programming books. Worked on the Sega Mega Drive version of "Wayne Gretzky Hockey" using a scripting language and Motorola 68K Assembly Language.

# Game Programming Starter Kit
The Game Programming Starter Kit was software that was released in 6 different versions by 2 different publishers (Sams and then McMillan). It was one of the best ways for new developers to learn game development with industry standard technologies. It is one of the few products that could almost guarantee to put students on the right path for the games industry.

## Version 1.0
<img src="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit1.0.jpg" />
The first version was released in 1994 by Andre LaMothe and published by Sams, it consisted of 2 CDs and a full 900 page physical copy of Teach Yourself Game Programming in 21 Days. Not only that but it contained the full retail version of Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0 along with the eBook version of Teach Yourself Visual C++ in 21 Days. 

It also claims to have a full 2D DOS game engine on the CDs but we don't know much information about it.

## Version 2.0
The Second version was released in 1997 by Macmillan Digital Publishing but I have never seen a copy to be able to detail what it contained and information online is severly lacking.

## Version 3.0
<img src="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit3.0.jpg" />
The Third version was released in 1999 by Macmillan Digital Publishing and consisted of 3 CDs and the full physical copy of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages**! 
It also includes the DirectX 6.1 SDK and an SDK called **Genesis 3D** but only included the Introductory Edition of Visual C++ 6.0. 
Genesis 3D did come with its own level editor which supported Direct3D and 3Dfx Glide drivers.

This time it contained three ebooks on the Disks:
* C++ Unleashed
* Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 Days
* Using Visual C++ 6

## Version 4.0
<img src="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit4.0.jpg" />
The Fourth version was released in 2000 by **Macmillan Software** and only consisted of 2 CDs this time. On those 2 CDs was the same Introductory Edition of Visual C++ 6.0 as the previous version and version 3.1 of the Genesis 3D SDK. The DirectX SDK was upated to version 7.0 and it came with a new 3D animation tool called **Shadow Realm Model Animator**.

This time it only contained two ebooks but they were arguably better for game development as it now includes DirectX:
* Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 Days
* Teach Yourself DirectX 7 in 24 Hours


The physical book that was included this time was the **Second** Edition of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages** by **Marc Saltzman** which is a really interesting book pulished by **BradyGames**.

## Version 5.0
<img src="/public/images/books/GameProgrammingStarterKit5.0.jpg" />
The Fifth version was released in 2001 by **Pearson Software** but we don't currently know what was on the CDs. We can presume it has Version 8 of DirectX and most likely the same Introductory Edition of Visual C++ 6.0 as the previous versions.

It also may have included software called **3D GameStudio Standard** version 5.12 but this is only confirmed by one source [^5].

We know that one of the eBooks included on the CDs was:
* Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus

We do know however that the physical book that was included this time was the **Third** Edition of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages** by **Marc Saltzman**. This books seems to be rather rare as I have never seen it for sale outside of this bundle.

## Version 6.0
The mythical sixth version may have released in 2002 but there is no photos of it existing at all online. One source claims it included **DarkBASIC SE** which is a large departure from the standard Visual C++ and DirectX of the previous versions.

Did it include a **Fourth** edition of **Game Design Secrets of the Sages**? Who Knows?
