# E3
SEGA was instrumental to setting up E3, in an interview with **Tom Kalinske** (former CEO of SEGA America) he had this to say about the formation of E3:
> In the early Nineties, CES was huge but it treated the gaming industry poorly.
> We were put in the back, past the new gadgets, computers and stereos and TVs.
> One year, we were in a tent and it was raining. Out Genesis machines got wet and I said,
> "That's it, we're not coming Back".
> We set out to form our own show with favoured third-parties. It became E3.
[^1]

## E3 1995 - The First E3
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMuJWADkMYY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
E3 1995 marked the first E3 event, created as an alternative to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) where the gaming industry was often overlooked.

At E3 1995, the gaming industry was undergoing significant changes, with the Super Nintendo still the most popular console in North America but with new hardware on the horizon, such as Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and the yet-to-be-released Ultra 64 (later Nintendo 64). This event was mainly focused on the Sega-Sony rivalry, with Nintendo's console release delayed until the following year.

E3 1995 consisted of exhibits and presentations, but unlike modern E3 events, there were no livestreams, special guest stars, or musical performances. The target audience was gaming industry professionals, retailers, developers, marketing teams, investors, and journalists, rather than gamers. As a result, these early E3 conferences were more subdued and focused on industry announcements rather than generating excitement among gamers.

# GDC - Game Developer's Conference
GDC stands for the "Game Developers Conference," which is an annual event held for professionals in the video game industry. GDC serves as a hub for game developers, publishers, artists, programmers, designers, and other industry experts to come together to discuss, share, and learn about the latest trends, technologies, and practices in game development. The event includes a wide range of sessions, panels, workshops, and networking opportunities.

## CGDC 1988
The first Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held in 1988. It was founded by Chris Crawford, a well-known game designer and developer, and it took place in his living room in San Jose, California. This initial gathering was relatively small (27) and informal compared to the later iterations of GDC, but it marked the beginning of what would become one of the most significant annual events in the video game industry. Since that modest start, GDC has grown in size and importance, attracting game developers and industry professionals from around the world.

## CGDC 2 - September 18th/19th 1988
The second Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held later in the same year, on September 18th and 19th 1988. It was sponsored by Computer Gaming World and would be the first GDC with a pre-planned agenda. It had about 150 atendees, a whole five times larger than the previous conference hosted earlier the same year.

You can find the main talks and their authors in the table below:

## CGDC 3 - 1989
Not much is known about the third version of the Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) hosted in Sunnyvale California sometime in 1989 and managed to double the previous atendence from 150 to 300.

## CGDC 1990 - April 1st-2nd
For a brief insight into the fourth version of CGDC you can read Bill Pirkle's observations in the June 1990 issue of Journal of Computer Game Design here: 
[Volume 3 Number 5. June 1990 ](https://www.erasmatazz.com/library/the-journal-of-computer/jcgd-volume-3/volume-3-number-5-june-1990.html)

It was hosted in Le Baron Hotel in San Jose and was atendeed by over 470 people.

## CGDC 1991 - April?
The Fifth CGDC was the first to have been directed by Ernest Adams just before his move to Electronic Arts where he would work on titles such as  John Madden Football [^2]. It was again hosted in San Jose this time in the Hyatt Hotel and recieved 550 atendees.

## CGDC 1992 - April 25th-26th
Hosted in the DoubleTree Hotel in Santa Clara California, the sixth CGDC was attended by over 600 game industry professionals.

## CGDC 1993
Again hosted in Santa Clara California but this time reaching 900 atendees, the seventh CGDC was becoming incredibly well known within the industry.

## CGDC 1994
Another hosted in Santa Clara California but this time reaching over the 1 thousand mark with 1250 atendees, it was the eighth CGDC.

## CGDC 1995

## CGDC 1996
This is the year it was sold to Miller Freeman for about 3 million dollars, now being run by a company many developers could feel the change in the conference becoming more corporate [^4].

---
## CGDC 1997 - April 25th-29th
The 1997 Computer Game Developers Conference was hosted in the Santa Clara Conference Center in Washington, D.C. It was much larger in scope than the previous years and in fact took five days instead of the usual two.

The first 2 days introducted two new sub-conferences:
* Managing Game Development Conference (25th/26th)
* Game Marketing and Distribution Conference (25th/26th)

The Classic CGDC Conference would then take the next three days (27th-29th).

The overall attendees was estimated to be over 6,300 by the July 2997 issue of Next Generation Magazine.

### Two Day Tutorials
This conference introduced what they called the **Two Day Tutorials** which were tutorials on various software that would take up the full first two days of the conference, presumably for those uninterested in the other two sub-conferences going on at the same time.

There were four of them but no other details apart from their name remain online:
* Softimage Game Development Tools and Techniques
* Object Oriented Game Design in Lingo
* 3D Studio Max
* Creating Online Games with Java

### One Day Tutorials
The tutorials were:
* Modeling, Texturing, and Animating in Alias Poweranimator for Real-Time Applications
* The Producer's Tutorial: Bringing it All Together

* The State of the Post-Christmas Game Market
* Online Marketing Strategies
* Games for Promotional Purposes: The Business of Business Games
* Leveraging 3D in Your Marketing Plan

The second day talks were:
* Market Research Boot Camp

* Maximizing Your Online Presence
* Working With Developers

Pretty much nothing is available online about who gave these talks or what they contained.

### Managing Game Development Conference

The first day talks were:
* Team == Software
* Lucid Ignorance
* Bullshit Management Meetings That Don't Suck
* Enrapturing the Customer
* Building That "Shared Vision Thing"

The Day 2 talks were:

* Being the Black Hats: Managing People Who Give a Shit
* Where Am I: Finding Yourself in Software
* The Deeper Problem: Breaking the Loop of Failure
* Thinking Fishbowl

Pretty much nothing is available online about who gave these talks or what they contained.

### Classic CGDC Conference Day One
Day one had 105 different sessions split up into the following four types:
* Lectures - Typical Conference presentation format with Powerpoint Slides
* Seminars - More hands on than Lectures
* Roundtables - Panel of experts talking about a specific talking and maybe answering audience questions
* Sponsored Sessions - Presumably lectures that were not voted on but instead paid to present

Microsoft had sessions advertising their DirectX technology (DirectPlay, DirectSound, Direct3D and DirectDraw) and even from their hardware division (Sidewinder Group).

There was even a session by Apple on using Quicktime for Windows Game Development! Would love to get a hold of what was presented at that session.
