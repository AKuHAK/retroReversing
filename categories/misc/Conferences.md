# Introduction
When taking a historical look at the Games Industry one of the most important sources of information are the Conferences that were held to share information when the industry was fresh.

This page will talk about the main Game-related conferences that took place over the period of time that we classify as "Retro", they roughly fit into two distinct categories:
* **Development** - Conferences for Sharing Game Development Information (SIGGRAPH, GDC)
* **Showcase** - Conferences for Showing off the latest Games and Gaming Hardware (CES, E3)

This table below lists all the conferences that we are aware about taking place up until 2000:

Conference | Dates | Category | Notes
---|---|---|---
3DO Developer Conference | 1992-1994 | Development |
Gamer Developers Conference (GDC) | 1988-Ongoing | Development |
CES | 1967-Ongoing | Showcase | 
E3 | 1995-Ongoing | Showcase | 
Digital World Conference | 1990-1995? | Development | 
Intertainment | 1988-1993? | Showcase | ACE Issue 40 covers the November 1990 Intertainment Conference
xFest | Aug 21st-23rd 2000 | Development | Microsoft Xbox Developer Conference

# GDC - Game Developer's Conference
GDC stands for the "Game Developers Conference," which is an annual event held for professionals in the video game industry. GDC serves as a hub for game developers, publishers, artists, programmers, designers, and other industry experts to come together to discuss, share, and learn about the latest trends, technologies, and practices in game development. The event includes a wide range of sessions, panels, workshops, and networking opportunities.

## CGDC 1988
The first Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held in 1988. It was founded by Chris Crawford, a well-known game designer and developer, and it took place in his living room in San Jose, California. This initial gathering was relatively small (27) and informal compared to the later iterations of GDC, but it marked the beginning of what would become one of the most significant annual events in the video game industry. Since that modest start, GDC has grown in size and importance, attracting game developers and industry professionals from around the world.

## CGDC 2 - September 18th/19th 1988
The second Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held later in the same year, on September 18th and 19th 1988. It was sponsored by Computer Gaming World and would be the first GDC with a pre-planned agenda. It had about 150 atendees, a whole five times larger than the previous conference hosted earlier the same year.

You can find the main talks and their authors in the table below:

This years show even had IBM trying to get people to write games for **OS/2** with their sponsored "OS/2 as a Viable PC Games Platform" sessions, I wonder how many developers were convinced because it certainly did not become a viable PC Games Platform and was competing with Windows 95 DirectX talks. I would love to see what content was presented at that, fantastic bit of game development history, what APIs were even shown off for OS/2?


## CGDC 1996
This is the last year before it was sold to Miller Freeman for about 3 million dollars, now being run by a company many developers could feel the change in the conference becoming more corporate [^4]. So this will be the last conference with a presentation by Chris Crawford.

Google Books claims to have the proceedings of the 1996 Computer Game Developers Conference in its library but it doesn't seem to be possible to access its contents: [Computer Game Developers' Conference Conference Proceedings: March 30-April ... - Google Books](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Computer_Game_Developers_Conference_Conf.html?id=bdgTAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)

## CGDC 1997 - April 25th-29th
The 1997 Computer Game Developers Conference was hosted in the Santa Clara Conference Center in Washington, D.C. It was much larger in scope than the previous years and in fact took five days instead of the usual two.

The first 2 days introducted two new sub-conferences:
* Managing Game Development Conference (25th/26th)
* Game Marketing and Distribution Conference (25th/26th)

The Classic CGDC Conference would then take the next three days (27th-29th).

The overall attendees was estimated to be over **6,300** by the July 2997 issue of Next Generation Magazine.

### Two Day Tutorials
This conference introduced what they called the **Two Day Tutorials** which were tutorials on various software that would take up the full first two days of the conference, presumably for those uninterested in the other two sub-conferences going on at the same time.

There were four of them but no other details apart from their name remain online:
* Softimage Game Development Tools and Techniques
* Object Oriented Game Design in Lingo
* 3D Studio Max
* Creating Online Games with Java

### One Day Tutorials
These tutorials only took a day to complete and were all on the 26th of April, they were:
* Modeling, Texturing, and Animating in Alias Poweranimator for Real-Time Applications
* The Producer's Tutorial: Bringing it All Together
* Programming Games Under Windows
* Writing for an Interactive Age
* Using DeBabilizer for Processing Video Game Graphics
* Writing Games with OpenGL

Sadly the website didn't list who actually presented these tutorials but if you know please submit a Pull Request or leave a comment below.

### Game Marketing and Distribution Conference

The first day talks were:
* Going Global: Worldwide Strategies for International Markets
* Breaking Into the Chinese Market: Market Entry, Publishing and Distribution of CD-Rom Titles in China
* Distribution Standards for the Game Industry 
* Internet Entertainment: The Profits and the Pitfalls
* Packaging
* Licensing
* How To Win At Distribution
* The State of the Post-Christmas Game Market
* Online Marketing Strategies
* Games for Promotional Purposes: The Business of Business Games
* Leveraging 3D in Your Marketing Plan
* Building on Success

The second day talks were:
* Market Research Boot Camp
* How to Create Branded Products That Cover Multiple Media
* Educating the Retailer
* Distribution Options For Today's Market
* Legal Issues In Online Distribution: Warnings About Unresolved Issues
* Strategic Pricing 
* Maximizing Your Online Presence
* Working With Developers
* Breaking into Latin American Markets
* Retailers Talk Back
* Brand Management: CD Rom into Film 
* Changing the Face of Interactive Entertainment
* Shaping the Interactive Software Market for the New Millenium

Pretty much nothing is available online about who gave these talks or what they contained.

### Managing Game Development Conference

The first day talks were:
* Team == Software
* Lucid Ignorance
* Bullshit Management Meetings That Don't Suck
* Enrapturing the Customer
* Building That "Shared Vision Thing"

The Day 2 talks were:
* Facing the Black Hats: Strategies for dealing with Management
* Being the Black Hats: Managing People Who Give a Shit
* Where Am I: Finding Yourself in Software
* The Deeper Problem: Breaking the Loop of Failure
* Thinking Fishbowl
* Creativity Shop: A Kick in Your Mental Ass Leading a Quality Jihad

Pretty much nothing is available online about who gave these talks or what they contained.

### Classic CGDC Conference Day One
Day one had 105 different sessions split up into the following four types:
* Lectures - Typical Conference presentation format with Powerpoint Slides
* Seminars - More hands on than Lectures
* Roundtables - Panel of experts talking about a specific talking and maybe answering audience questions
* Sponsored Sessions - Presumably lectures that were not voted on but instead paid to present

All the talks from the first day of the "Classic" Computer Developers Conference are in the table below. If you know of any links to videos, slides, reviews or even notes from any of the sessions please add them to the Notes column in the table.

Microsoft had sessions advertising their DirectX technology (DirectPlay, DirectSound, Direct3D and DirectDraw) and even from their hardware division (Sidewinder Group).

There was even a session by Apple on using Quicktime for Windows Game Development! Would love to get a hold of what was presented at that session.

### Microsoft DirectX Developer Day (March 8th)
It included a "Microsoft DirectX Developer Day" on the 8th of March held by Hicrosoft who presented multiple lectures explaining how to use the new functions of the DirectX 8 SDK. The knowledge about DirectX 8 was so cutting-edge that it required a  Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be signed to even attend [^6]! But you would walk out not just having the knowledge of DirectX8 but also an early build exclusive to atendees.

It began with a speech by Chris Jones, about the current state and future of Windows games. Next, Brian Moran, program manager of the company's Windows Division, held a session on precautions in the production of Windows 2000 compatible game software.

The lectures prepared at Microsoft DirectX Developer Day are divided into three areas: 
* Graphics (DirectDraw, Direct3D)
* Audio and Streaming (DirectSound, DirectShow)
* Network and input (DirectPlay, DirectInput)

There were 5 lectures for 1 hour in each field, so a total of 15 sessions were held.

From the original website it looks like the sessions were roughly the following:
* DirectX 8.0 Graphics Architecture - Faster and easier than ever!
* Direct3D 8.0 Base Functionality - Where it all starts
* Direct3D 8.0 Vertex Processing - Look what you can do with vertices now!
* Direct3D 8.0 Pixel Processing - And you thought the vertex operations were cool...
* High level technologies - Making things even easier to use
* DirectX 8.0 Audio Architecture - Closer integration of DirectSound and DirectMusic for maximum flexibility
* DirectX 8.0 Audio FX - Enrich your game audio environment
* DirectX 8.0 Audio Scripting - Enable post-authoring of your game audio environment
* DirectShow 8.0 - Movies, video editing, and using the new DirectX plug-in architecture
* DirectPlay 8.0 Architecture - Designed for massive multiplayer online games
* DirectPlay Voice - Take your online game to the next level!
* DirectInput Mapper - Easily add device optimized support to your game
* DirectInput Mapper CPL - How to use and customize to match your game UI
* Application Manager - Turn your game into a drop-n-play experience!

Note that although we don't have much details on the contents of each of the talks, there is a physical Binder available at the Museum of Play: [Microsoft DirectX Developer Day binder, 2000 - The Strong](https://archives.museumofplay.org/repositories/3/archival_objects/34613)

# Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 
CES stands for the "Consumer Electronics Show." It is an annual trade show and convention that serves as a showcase for the latest consumer electronics and technology products. CES is one of the most significant and influential tech events globally, and it's where many companies, including industry giants and startups, unveil and demonstrate their innovative products and technologies.

CES is known for its extensive exhibition of consumer electronics and technology products, ranging from smartphones and televisions to smart home devices, automotive technology, gaming hardware, and more.

CES attracts a large number of journalists, bloggers, and media outlets from around the world, generating extensive press coverage and reviews of the showcased products.

CES has played a crucial role in unveiling groundbreaking technologies and products that have subsequently shaped the consumer electronics and technology industries. It is a significant annual event for both industry professionals and tech enthusiasts interested in the latest advancements in the world of electronics and innovation.

The first Consumer Electronics Show (CES) took place in 1967. CES was initially held in New York City and later moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Although it features gaming products they have always brushed the games industry aside in favour of more mainstream consumer electronics.

# Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)

E3, which stands for the "Electronic Entertainment Expo," is one of the most prominent and anticipated events in the video game industry. It serves as a showcase for the latest video games, gaming hardware, and interactive entertainment. E3 brings together game developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers, and gamers to unveil and celebrate upcoming titles and innovations in the world of gaming.

## Creation of E3
SEGA was instrumental to setting up E3, in an interview with **Tom Kalinske** (former CEO of SEGA America) he had this to say about the formation of E3:
> In the early Nineties, CES was huge but it treated the gaming industry poorly.
> We were put in the back, past the new gadgets, computers and stereos and TVs.
> One year, we were in a tent and it was raining. Out Genesis machines got wet and I said,
> "That's it, we're not coming Back".
> We set out to form our own show with favoured third-parties. It became E3.
[^1]

## E3 1995 - The First E3
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMuJWADkMYY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
E3 1995 marked the first E3 event, created as an alternative to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) where the gaming industry was often overlooked.

At E3 1995, the gaming industry was undergoing significant changes, with the Super Nintendo still the most popular console in North America but with new hardware on the horizon, such as Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and the yet-to-be-released Ultra 64 (later Nintendo 64). This event was mainly focused on the Sega-Sony rivalry, with Nintendo's console release delayed until the following year.

E3 1995 consisted of exhibits and presentations, but unlike modern E3 events, there were no livestreams, special guest stars, or musical performances. The target audience was gaming industry professionals, retailers, developers, marketing teams, investors, and journalists, rather than gamers. As a result, these early E3 conferences were more subdued and focused on industry announcements rather than generating excitement among gamers.
