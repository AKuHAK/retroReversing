One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the magazines that were available at the time, both game specific magazines and digital/creative magazines have a wealth of information.

# Games Specific Magazines

## PSi-2 Magazine
Published by Thin-Ice Media (Owned by Datel) it was the only non-official Playstation 2 magazine to include a playable CD every issue. 
Each CD would contain a few Action Replay Cheats and save games that can be applied to a few select games, it formed as a good advertisement to Datel's Action Replay product.

### PSi-2 Magazine CDs
Some of the Magazine CDs/DVDs contained Video content on behind the scenes information for upcoming games, such as interviews with developers.

Issue Number | Content
---|---
21 | Trailers for Auto Modellista, Red Dread Revolver, Dino Stalker, JoJo's Bizare Adventure and others
22 | Behind the Scenes of V-Rally 3
23 | Talking about the Mechanics of The Thing
28 | Trailer of travel documentaries from Pilot Guides to places like Mexico, Spain, India ([Pilot Film and Television Productions Home Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20010517025522/http://www.pilot.co.uk/))
29 | The Making of Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness

# Creative Magazines
Creative Magazines related to topics such as art/3d graphics and even web development are just as valuable a source as gaming magazines for the time as they would often talk about industry events and software that were often used by game developers.

## Computer Arts (UK)
Computer Arts was a popular UK magazine dedicated to 2D and 3D creation on PC/Mac, so it contains a wealth of information related to asset creation for game development.

### Book Extracts
The accompaning CD for Computer Arts often had extracts from popular industy books in PDF format, this was a great way to both advertise the book in question and supply useful content for artists. Much of these are extracts from books that game artists would almost certainly have in their collection.

### Free Resources
Often the CDs would contain free resources from around the Web, such as a few sample hours of Video training courses or templates/images. One awesome thing they started doing was including full PDFs for issues from 2 years prior but sadly this didn't last very long.

### Free Full products
Occassionally as an incentive to buy the magazine there would be a few paid products that are offered "free" as long as you have bought the magazine. Not all issues included free full products but the ones that did were generally worth picking up, but of course it was always an older version of the products as an incentive to upgrade to the latest versions.

## Web Designer Magazine (UK)
Web Designer Magazine was a popular UK magazine purely dedicated to Web development, it was a relaunch of a previous magazine called **Practical Internet** and was known by the lengthy title **Practical Internet Web Designer** from issue 86 until dropping the prefix altogether by issue 95 in 2004.

It was initially published by **Highbury House** until they went into receivership on January 20th 2006 where it was bought by Imagine Publishing, which eventually it was sold to Future Publishing and then discontinued at issue 293 [confirmation required].

### Total Web Design
Strangely for a magazine dedicated to Web Development, there was no website for the magazine or even its sister title “Practical Web Projects”. This changed in mid 2004 when bought 

Issue number 97 from August 2004 had a behind the scenes look at the creation of the website, Luckily the Wayback machine has an archive of the website: 
[Total Web Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20040730202310/http://www.total-web-design.com/) 

### Editors
It was edited by Thomas Watson from the rename of Practical Internet in 2003 until issue 101 where it was taken over by Mark Hattersley in issue 104. Issue 102-103 did not have an editor and was simply signed off by “The Web Designer Team”.

### Issues
Each issue had a main focus but they all contained tutorials for a wide variety of software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, PHP and Flash.
