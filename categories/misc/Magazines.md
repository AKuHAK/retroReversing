One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the magazines that were available at the time, both game specific magazines and digital/creative magazines have a wealth of information.

# Games Specific Magazines

## PSi-2 Magazine
Published by Thin-Ice Media (Owned by Datel) it was the only non-official Playstation 2 magazine to include a playable CD every issue. 
Each CD would contain a few Action Replay Cheats and save games that can be applied to a few select games, it formed as a good advertisement to Datel's Action Replay product.

### PSi-2 Magazine CDs
Some of the Magazine CDs/DVDs contained Video content on behind the scenes information for upcoming games, such as interviews with developers.

Issue Number | Content
---|---
21 | Trailers for Auto Modellista, Red Dread Revolver, Dino Stalker, JoJo's Bizare Adventure and others
22 | Behind the Scenes of V-Rally 3
23 | Talking about the Mechanics of The Thing
28 | Trailer of travel documentaries to places like Mexico, Spain, India

# Creative Magazines
Creative Magazines related to topics such as art/3d graphics and even web development are just as valuable a source as gaming magazines for the time as they would often talk about industry events and software that were often used by game developers.

## Web Designer Magazine (UK)
Web Designer Magazine was a popular UK magazine purely dedicated to Web development, it was a relaunch of a previous magazine called **Practical Internet** and was known by the lengthy title **Practical Internet Web Designer** from issue 86 until dropping the prefix altogether by issue 95 in 2004.

It was initially published by **Highbury House** until they went into receivership on January 20th 2006 where it was bought by Imagine Publishing, which eventually it was sold to Future Publishing and then discontinued at issue 293 [confirmation required].

### Total Web Design
Strangely for a magazine dedicated to Web Development, there was no website for the magazine or even its sister title “Practical Web Projects”. This changed in mid 2004 when bought 

Issue number 97 from August 2004 had a behind the scenes look at the creation of the website, Luckily the Wayback machine has an archive of the website: 
[Total Web Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20040730202310/http://www.total-web-design.com/) 

### Editors
It was edited by Thomas Watson from the rename of Practical Internet in 2003 until issue 101 where it was taken over by Mark Hattersley in issue 104. Issue 102-103 did not have an editor and was simply signed off by “The Web Designer Team”.

### Issues
Each issue had a main focus but they all contained tutorials for a wide variety of software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, PHP and Flash.

The issues we know about are listed in the table below:
