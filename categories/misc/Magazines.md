One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the magazines that were available at the time, both game specific magazines and digital/creative magazines have a wealth of information.

# Games Specific Magazines

## PSi-2 Magazine
Published by Thin-Ice Media (Owned by Datel) it was the only non-official Playstation 2 magazine to include a playable CD every issue. 
Each CD would contain a few Action Replay Cheats and save games that can be applied to a few select games, it formed as a good advertisement to Datel's Action Replay product.

### PSi-2 Magazine CDs
Some of the Magazine CDs/DVDs contained Video content on behind the scenes information for upcoming games, such as interviews with developers.

Issue Number | Content
