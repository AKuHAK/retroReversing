What do you call a product that collects articles from monthly magazines into a single yearly publication? 
The publishers came up with the term "Bookazine" to cover this concept of a very large magazine related to a specific topic.

Many of these were published with topics related to the Games Industry such as 3D Modelling, Animation, Photoshop, Programming or even just Games themselves.
