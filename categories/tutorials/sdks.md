# Introduction to Software Development Kits (SDKs)
Software Development Kits come in all shapes and sizes, some are built by the games console manufacture themselves and others are built by 3rd-party companies.

We have tried to document all the software development kits available for the most popular retro consoles, so hopefully you will find the posts below helpful.

# Nintendo Console Software Development Kits

## Nintendo Entertainment System (NES/Famicom)
No information is known about if an official NES SDK ever existed, it may have just been documentation about the NES hardware given to developers and the developers needed to pick their own tools.

## Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES/Super Famicom)
No information is known about if an official SNES SDK ever existed, it may have just been documentation about the NES hardware given to developers and the developers needed to pick their own tools.

However we do know that **Sculptured Software** had their own custom SDK known as the SSDS (Sculptured Software Development System) which was released to the internet and we will have a post on this in the future.

## Nintendo 64

# Nintendo Handheld Software Development Kits
From at least the Game Boy Advance Software development kits for Nintendo's handheld systems were often provided by Nintendo themselves via their online dev portal known as **WarioWorld**.

## Nintendo Game Boy (DMG & GBC)
A few files were leaked from Nintendos development FTP server in the early 2000s, this has allowed us to document some of the known tools that were found in the Game Boy Software development kit:
