This guide is for all beginners who are interesting in learning more about the technical details of their favourite consoles and games. The guide aims to be as console-agnostic as possible,  but after you have completed this you should look into the details of the specific console you are interested in.

# Lesson 1 - What? Why? How?
Many people are confused about what exactly is involved in reverse engineering or why exactly people would "waste their time" on such a task. Well lets find out...

## What is Reverse engineering?
Presumably by being on this page you at least have a slight idea about what reverse engineering is and may even have some pre-conceptions. 

At the end of the day it really is what it says on the tin, "Reverse engineering" taking the engineering process in reverse from finished product to learn how it was made.

A reverse engineer is a scientist that studies man-made object rather than natural phenomena.

## Why reverse retro games?
Ok but why exactly would people spend their time reverse engineering an old game instead of creating brand new games?

There are many reasons for this such as pure nostalgia and preservation of a part of our modern history, the same way people study traditional art, studying games is a rather obscure version of appreciating human history.

When a game is reverse engineered it becomes open to new life, new levels, sounds and more hours of fun. Reversing is like a game inside the game, when you have finished playing the game the fun of reversing can begin!

## Why learn reverse engineering?
It is almost guaranteed to make you a better programmer, you are studying the code of very intelligent developers and you can learn from both their genius and their mistakes.

Not only that but you will start to understand in depth how computers work and it can help protect your own games from hackers and may even start you on a path learning about cyber security and malware protection.

## What is the benefit to having reversed a game?
The most obvious benefit is to allow people to get more from their games, enjoy more hours in their favourite games, get that nostalgic buzz! 

Whether that is translating a game into a new language, improving the sound or visuals, or porting a classic game to a more modern system, you are bringing the enjoyment that this game gave to you to brand new audiences.

It might not exactly be saving lives in the traditional sense, but the hours of joy you can bring to gamers old and new is priceless.

## Is reverse engineering legal?
Yes, in fact there are many cases where the courts have sided with the reverse-engineer when it comes to anti-competitive practises.

If you are interested there are a few court battles that are relevant:
* [SEGA vs Accolade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_v._Accolade#Settlement)
* [Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp. - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp.)

In fact reverse engineering already plays a vital role in ensuring your freedom in an increasingly more technological society. How do you know a voting machine is accurately counting your vote? Or how do you know if your computer is spying on you? You could reverse engineer it and find out.
