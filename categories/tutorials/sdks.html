## Nintendo Entertainment System (NES/Famicom)
No information is known about if an official NES SDK ever existed, it may have just been documentation about the NES hardware given to developers and the developers needed to pick their own tools.

## Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES/Super Famicom)
No information is known about if an official SNES SDK ever existed, it may have just been documentation about the NES hardware given to developers and the developers needed to pick their own tools.

However we do know that **Sculptured Software** had their own custom SDK known as the SSDS (Sculptured Software Development System) which was released to the internet and we will have a post on this in the future.
