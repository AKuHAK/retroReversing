# History of Codemasters
Codemasters is a British video game developer and publisher known for its long history in the gaming industry.

It was founded by brothers Richard and David Darling in 1986. 

The company initially began by developing and publishing games for home computers of the era, such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC.

## CD-ROM for the Nintendo Entertainment System
In issue 1 of the UK Magazine GamesX the following was printed:
![CD-ROM for the NES](https://github.com/RetroReversing/retroReversing/assets/40120498/081b44bd-d708-4653-ace4-33bedb106335)

Sadly this was just the company Camerica jumping the gun to announce a product that hadn't even began development (no prototype or even designs) as confirmed by David Darling himself [^1].
