# Introduction
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let us take a moment to appreciate the work Datel did 20 years ago, reverse engineering and developing their own playable unofficial PS2 DVD discs which contained the watermark and decryption key required to boot code which could not be done with a consumer DVD burner.

# DOS PC Action Replay: The Ultimate Game Buster
Infinite cheat codes, save states, memory monitoring, slow motion, and more! This 1993 ISA card version of the Datel Pro Action Replay for DOS computers is packed with odd features. Check it out in this episode of **LGR Oddware**:

# Nintendo 64

## Game Killer
Before the Pro Action Replay was released for the N64 Datel decided to release a similar product but instead of allowing memory editing via cheat codes it had a few built in games and would write to the SRAM (Battery backed up save data inside the cartridge).
So for example if you plugged in Mario 64 it would edit the save data to give you all the stars and 100% completion.
Not as useful as Action Replay as it pretty much completes the game for you, hence the name ‚ÄúGame Killer‚Äù.

One cool feature was that the cartridge has a card slot on it for ‚ÄúKiller cards‚Äù which were supposed to be cards that add support for other games but sadly none were ever released. This would be a cool reversing project to see if anyone can implement a working card for the Game Killer!
