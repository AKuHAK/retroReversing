# Introduction
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let us take a moment to appreciate the work Datel did 20 years ago, reverse engineering and developing their own playable unofficial PS2 DVD discs which contained the watermark and decryption key required to boot code which could not be done with a consumer DVD burner.

# Action Replay PS2
Of course they are most famous of their Action Replay (AR) cheat devices, which would have never have received approval from Sony. Modifying memory in the way AR does would be too much of a security risk in terms of piracy/exploits.

However unlike cartridge based versions it didn‚Äôt have the Code Creation capability and thus you were reliant on the codes created by the ‚ÄúCodeJunkies‚Äù team. You could get these codes either on the website or use the #PS2 modem to connect to the servers, that was a nice touch!

But it didn‚Äôt stop there, the ability to print unofficial PS2 Discs was unique to Datel and thus they could sell products without giving a cut to Sony. So it was cheap for Datel to bring products to market, which allowed them to do cheaper per-game equivalents of Action Replay...

There were many of these released for a third of the price of AR. However I believe the standard AR could do all the same cheats and would work out cheaper in the long run if you wanted to cheat in more than 3 games.

One of the best examples is when they used their  technology to add official team names into PES3 which  was not allowed to use the official FIFA names. AFAIK it was not possible to do with with just AR codes/saves so this product was required.

If you look at the Max Payne version, it is releasing the same day as the retail game which suggests Datel seem to have had early access to the final games before their release date. Other region versions wouldn't have all the same codes as they would have been re-compiled...

# Nintendo 64

## Game Killer
Before the Pro Action Replay was released for the N64 Datel decided to release a similar product but instead of allowing memory editing via cheat codes it had a few built in games and would write to the SRAM (Battery backed up save data inside the cartridge).
So for example if you plugged in Mario 64 it would edit the save data to give you all the stars and 100% completion.
Not as useful as Action Replay as it pretty much completes the game for you, hence the name ‚ÄúGame Killer‚Äù.

One cool feature was that the cartridge has a card slot on it for ‚ÄúKiller cards‚Äù which were supposed to be cards that add support for other games but sadly none were ever released. This would be a cool reversing project to see if anyone can implement a working card for the Game Killer!
