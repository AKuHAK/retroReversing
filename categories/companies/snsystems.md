# History of SN Systems
SN Systems is a company that specialised in creating development tools for game developers in the UK, it was founded in 1988 by Martin Day and Andy Beveridge[^1].

They were looking for good development tools for the Atari ST and CBM Amiga but as none met their criteria they decided to create their own, and thankfully they did as without this, game development would not be the same today.

Their first product was the SN Systems assembler (SNASM) which was such a success that fellow British-based development tool creator **Cross Products** decided to license it and thus it became the de facto standard for Mega Drive Game Development around the world [^1].

## Products

### SNASM (SN Systems Assembler)
The original SNASM was a custom assembler written by SN Systems to target . 

It was such a useful product that **Cross Products** licensed it and distrubuted it with their development toolkits, which helped make it the most popular Mega Drive Assembler available.

Cross Products then built upon the product and released their own version called SNASM2, which would later become a competitor for SN Systems next development kit known as PSY-Q.

### PSY-Q
PSY-Q was a development kit born from an agreement between popular UK-based game developer Psygnosis and SN Systems to develop a state of the art development kit based on the C-programming language.

The Psy-Q development was such a success for Sony PS1 development that it actually became the oggicially licensed development kit for the platform and SN Systems was later bought by Sony.

Even although SN Systems were bought by Sony for their Psy-Q development kit, it supported a competing platform under the Psy-Q branding, the Sega Saturn!
