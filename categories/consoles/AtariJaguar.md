# Introduction
Welcome to our page dedicated to Atari Jaguar reverse engineering! 
The Atari Jaguar is a classic video game console that was first released in North America suring November 1993. 

If you're interested in learning more about the technical aspects of this console and how it works, you've come to the right place. On this page, we've compiled a list of links to other pages that cover various topics related to Atari Jaguar reverse engineering. 

Whether you're interested in understanding the hardware architecture of the console, analyzing game code, or exploring the many mods and hacks that have been created by enthusiasts over the years, you'll find a wealth of resources and information on the pages we've linked to. So grab your controller, fire up your Atari Jaguar, and get ready to dive into the exciting world of Atari Jaguar reverse engineering!

# Development Kit

## Hardware used for Alien vs predator
In an interview for Wireframe magazine **Jane Whittaker** talks about all the hardware sent over to her parents house in Yorkshire which gives us an insight into the hardware required to make Atari Jaguar games.

They (Jane and Mike Beaton) moved from Atari's San Fransisco office back to the UK due to home sickness and Atari supported this by sending development hardware all the way to the UK to set up a make shift office in Jane's parents house.

They got sent **Atari TT** machines and monitors, prototype Atari Jaguars, a couple of PCs and presumably all the cables to fit everything together.

This was how they developed Alien vs Predator for the Atari Jaguar.

## Official Atari Jaguar Development Manual
The official "Atari Jaguar Development Manual" is available over on **archive.org** with thanks to Lars Hannig for scanning:
> After the demise of Atari and the declaration of the Jaguar as an open platform, Lars Hannig had the chance to acquire this piece of essential information and was kind enough to put many weeks into scanning page by page of the hundreads of pages you see in front of you. All this was done to support the Atari Jaguar community and give upcoming and current developers the one of a kind chance to get insight into the many unknown aspects of Atari Jaguar development. Essential information they would probably never get into their hands otherwise.
