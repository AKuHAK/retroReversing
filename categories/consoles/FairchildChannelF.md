This was the year the **Fairchild Channel F** was released, the first ever games console with interchangeable cartridges (ROMs) and the first to be based on a microprocessor (Fairchild F8).

Fairchild released a development kit which came with a book titled **F8 Guide to Programming**, if you were a developer at the time who wanted to write games for the Channel F then this would be the go-to book!
