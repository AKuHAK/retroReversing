# GP32 (Game Park Holdings)
The GP32 is a handheld gaming console developed by the South Korean company Game Park Holdings. 
It was released in November 2001. 
One of the notable features of the GP32 was its open architecture, which allowed independent developers to create and distribute their own games and applications for the platform without the need for official licensing or approval.

The GP32 was powered by a 133 MHz ARM 920T (32-bit RISC) processor and featured a 320x240 pixel LCD screen. 
It utilized SmartMedia cards for game storage, allowing users to easily swap out games and applications. The device also had built-in support for MP3 playback and electronic books, expanding its functionality beyond gaming.

Although the GP32 did not achieve the same level of commercial success as some of its competitors, such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, it gained a dedicated following among enthusiasts and indie developers due to its open nature and potential for homebrew development.

## GP32 Games
There were 28 commercial games released for the GP32, Wikipedia has a page listing them all:
