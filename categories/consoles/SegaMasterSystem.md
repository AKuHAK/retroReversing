# Developer Interviews

## US Gold Interview
SMS Power has re-posted an interview from **Zero** magazine issue 7 where they interview the game developers at **US Gold** on developing the games Impossible Mission and Gauntlet.

Apparently Impossible Mission for the Sega Master System will be on a 128K cartridge which is comprised of:
* 16K Code (Z80 Machine Code)
* 70K Graphics
* 20K Sound

For development hardware they used an ordinary PC with Z80 assembler connected to a Sega Master System via a **Z80 Probe** which plugs into the CPU slot on the motherboard (instead of the CPU). It also mentions that they use RAM to hold the game data instead of a ROM Chip, so predumably there is some interface between the PC and the RAM chip to be able to write the game data to it. It mentions that this is fast but as as fast as PDS which is another Master System development kit.
