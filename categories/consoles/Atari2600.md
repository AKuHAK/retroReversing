The Atari 2600 was released in 1977 and sold more than 30 million consoles in the decade it was on the market, to say it was successful would be an understatement.

The first games for the Atari 2600 were developed on the **JOLT** which was a low-cost 6502 computer, in fact the original prototype for the Atari 2600 was based on a Jolt computer with hand wired modification and joysticks from the arcade version of the TANK arcade game [^1].

For more information about the JOLT check out this page:

## Atari 7800 Development kit
In the UK magazine **Zero** issue 7 there is an interview with the game developer **US Gold** where it mentions they are working on Atari 7800 games such as Gauntlet and it gives a brief description of the Development Kit they are using:
> The 7800 development kit comprises the following: a Mega ST running Atari's proprietary combination 6502/68000 assembler, lead from ST to 7800 RAM cartridge and downloading software [^2].
