The Atari 2600 was released in 1977 and sold more than 30 million consoles in the decade it was on the market, to say it was successful would be an understatement.

# Development Kit

## JOLT
The first games for the Atari 2600 were developed on the **JOLT** which was a low-cost 6502 computer, in fact the original prototype for the Atari 2600 was based on a Jolt computer with hand wired modification and joysticks from the arcade version of the TANK arcade game [^1].
