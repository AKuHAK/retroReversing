# Introduction to Hacking the Nintendo 64
Interested in learning more about the the N64? Excellent! This section will guide you through the basics, starting from basic MIPS assembly language all the way to an introduction to reverse engineering your first game!

{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/N64Reversing" description="For an introduction on reverse engineering N64 games check out this post." %}

## Nintendo 64 Assembly Language (MIPS)
Although most Nintendo 64 games are written in C or C++, they all get compiled down to MIPS assembly code, so this is what you will mainly be working with when reverse enginneering, so it is good to at least have a basic knowledge before getting started.
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/N64MipsAssembly" description="For an introduction to N64 MIPS assembly check out this set of video tutorials." %}

## Nintendo 64 Boot Code
Every game produced for the N64 required a little piece of code known as the "bootloader" or boot code to initialise the state of the console. You don't have to know anything about this, apart from that it exists and tends to execute in the address space `0xa4000000` to `0xa4000b64`.
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/n64bootcode" description="For more information on the boot code check out this post." %}

## Nintendo 64 Emulation
We reccomend using the `Reversers Edition` of the Mupen64+ emulator as it provides useful features for reverse engineering such as auto detection of functions.

## Nintendo 64 Sound and Music

# N64 Game reversing
There are a couple of different types of reverse engineering when it comes to Nintendo 64 games, these are listed in the sections below.

## Partial Game Reversing
The goal of a partial game reversing project is to understand and document how games "work", for example how did the developers implement the characters animation or jump mechanics.
This can be beneficial for game developers and anyone who is interested in how games are made, they can also be beneficial for speed runners due to the better understanding of how to exploit the game.

The output of this type of project is normally documentation which goes in detail on how a specific game feature works.
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/mario-kart-64/" description="For an example of a partial reversal of MarioKart64 check out this post." %}
  
## Full Game Reversing
Recently there has been a growing interest in reversing Nintendo 64 games back to source code that when compiled is binary-compatible with the original ROM.
These projects take a very long time but in the end are hugely rewarding, they result in full source code that can be compiled and even ported to other hardware.
With the source code it is trivial to understand how the game works and can be the basis for future game mods.


## N64 Game modding
Unlike a full game reversal project a Mod goes in the opposite direction by changing the original game to add new levels, textures, music and even alter the games code and physics engine.
The Game Modding category also includes translation patches to convert the game's text to another language, which can bring many region-exclusive games to a world-wide audience.

## N64 Cheats, Secrets & Gitches
Whether you just want to get further in your favourite game, unlock hidden content or even completely corrupt/glitch the game, you can use a cheat cartridge such as Action Replay or emulator memory editing to change games in real-time.

# N64 Anti-piracy
The main Nintendo 64 anti-piracy measure was the enhanced `CIC` chip based on the Super Nintendos CIC chip design but far more secure.
This was a mechanisim to prevent cartridges being produced without Nintendo's licensing fee.

## 3rd Party tricks for unlicenced Carts
During the N64's lifetime there were various unlicenced devices that ignored the CIC chip such as game backup devices (e.g Bung's Dr V64), game cheat cartrdges (e.g Equalizer/Action Replay) and region unlockers (Passport Plus).
Most required a legitimate cartridge to be inserted into the back and used that for the CIC chip communication.

# Development Kits (Hardware)
Development kits are released to game developers before the launch of the system to allow games to be developed for the system's launch. These systems would evolve over the systems lifespan and contained useful features for debugging and optimizing games for the platform. These systems were not just limited to the official offerings by nintendo as a few other publishers had their own versions of development hardware.

## Official Development Kits
The official development kt for the N64 was a partnership between SGI and Intelligent Systems and the hardware evolved over time. THe first development kit released was a modified `SGI ONYX` provided by SGI and contained similar hardware to the final N64.
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/sgi-onyx/" description="For more information on the original N64 Devkit check out this post." %}

## 3rd Party Development Kits
There were a few third party developers who created their own custom development kits for the Nintendo 64. One of the main developers for 3rd party devkits was SN Systems with their Maestro64 aimed at 3D and Sound artists and with a much cheaper price tag than an official N64 devkit.

# Software Development Kits

## Official Software development kit
A version of the Nintendo 64 SDK was released on the internet allowing you to use the same tools that your favourite developer used back-in-the-day. This can be useful if you are aiming for a 100% accurate decompilation of a game that can be compiled to the byte-identical ROM.

# Source Code

## Official Source Code
Up until very recently there has been litte official N64 source code released, just a few examples that come with the released SDKs. This changed very suddenly when 2 retail games had their source code leaked at roughly the same time, these games were `Turok - Dinosaur Hunter` and `Mortal Kombat 64`.

Studying the source code for these games can give vital insight into what it was like developing games back in the mid to late 90s when the Nintendo 64 was at the cutting-edge. The information gained from this can be very useful to help you reverse engineer the games back into retail-like source code.

## Homebrew Source Code
There are some fantastic open source projects in the Nintendo 64 homebrew community, these range from tech demos to full games and everything in between.
One excellent example of source code provided by the homebrew community is Peter Lemon's N64 Bare Metal Mips programming examples:
