# N64 Game reversing
There are a couple of different types of reverse engineering when it comes to Nintendo 64 games, these are listed in the sections below.

## Partial Game Reversing
The goal of a partial game reversing project is to understand and document how games "work", for example how did the developers implement the characters animation or jump mechanics.
This can be beneficial for game developers and anyone who is interested in how games are made, they can also be beneficial for speed runners due to the better understanding of how to exploit the game.
The output of this type of project is normally documentation which goes in detail on how a specific game feature works.
  
## Full Game Reversing
Recently there has been a growing interest in reversing Nintendo 64 games back to source code that when compiled is binary-compatible with the original ROM.
These projects take a very long time but in the end are hugely rewarding, they result in full source code that can be compiled and even ported to other hardware.
With the source code it is trivial to understand how the game works and can be the basis for future game mods.

## N64 Game modding
Unlike a full game reversal project a Mod goes in the opposite direction by changing the original game to add new levels, textures, music and even alter the games code and physics engine.
The Game Modding category also includes translation patches to convert the game's text to another language, which can bring many region-exclusive games to a world-wide audience.

# N64 Anti-piracy
The main Nintendo 64 anti-piracy measure was the enhanced `CIC` chip based on the Super Nintendos CIC chip design but far more secure.
This was a mechanisim to prevent cartridges being produced without Nintendo's licensing fee.

## 3rd Party tricks for unlicenced Carts
During the N64's lifetime there were various unlicenced devices that ignored the CIC chip such as game backup devices (e.g Bung's Dr V64), game cheat cartrdges (e.g Equalizer/Action Replay) and region unlockers (Passport Plus).
Most required a legitimate cartridge to be inserted into the back and used that for the CIC chip communication.
