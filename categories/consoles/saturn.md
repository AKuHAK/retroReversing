# Introduction to Hacking the Sega Saturn
Interested in learning more about the the Saturn? Excellent! This section will guide you through the basics, starting from basic architecture all the way to an introduction to reverse engineering your first game!

## Sega Saturn Exclusives
When it comes to finding a game to reverse engineer it can be helpful to look at games that are cross-platform to compare builds. But the most valuable reverse engineering projects tend to be the platform exclusives as these are games people can no longer play on modern consoles.

## Sega Saturn Graphics

# Development Kits (Hardware)
Development kits are released to game developers before the launch of the system to allow games to be developed for the system's launch. These systems would evolve over the systems lifespan and contained useful features for debugging and optimizing games for the platform. These systems were not just limited to the official offerings by nintendo as a few other publishers had their own versions of development hardware.

## Official Development Kits
The official development kit for the N64 was a partnership between SEGA and Sophia and the hardware evolved over time. The first development kit released was called the `Saturn Programming box` or `P-box` and evolved into the `Cart-Dev` system.

## 3rd Party Development Kits
There were a few third party developers who created their own custom development kits for the Sega Saturn. One of the main developers for 3rd party devkits was SN Systems with their PSYQ Saturn with a much cheaper price tag than an official Sega devkit.
