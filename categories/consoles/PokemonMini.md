# Introduction to the Pokemon Mini
Unlike previously thought, Nintendo did not actually create custom hardware for the Pokemon Mini, as it was recently found out that the CPU is actually a standard Seiko model that was previously used to power similar devices with small LCDs.

The hardware for the Pokemon Mini was provided by `Seiko EPSON` which included a 8-bit CPU called the `S1C88` , it was a cpu that was commonly sold for small portable devices such as watches or pedometers.

## Browser-based Emulator
The developer `Scylus` has created a brand new browser-based (javascript) Pokemon Mini emulator which wile not yet as stable as PokeMini emulator it supports the official S1C88 assembly language. It even contains basic debugging support but there are a few known bugs which cause inaccuracies in the emulation.
