  <p>The Nintendo 64 has only been fully reverse engineered recently with the work on understanding the new CIC chip installed in each game cartridge.
  During the N64's lifetime there were various unlicenced devices that ignored the CIC chip such as game backup devices (e.g Bung's Dr V64), game cheat cartrdges (e.g Equalizer/Action Replay) and region unlockers (Passport Plus).
  Most required a legitimate cartridge to be inserted into the back and used that for the CIC chip communication.</p>
