# Game Development at Taito
Taito put together a 250-page Hardware Manual for new developers who joined the team to learn how to create an Arcade game from scratch using RAM/ROM/CPU chips and a standard TV. This was before the internet and even before there were many books on the topic when the industry was very new and companies didn't want to share their "trade secrets".

They used an In-Circuit Emulator to debug the programs they were creating as can be seen in this diagram:
