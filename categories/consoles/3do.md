# Development Hardware
The 3DO offers a comprehensive development environment, even incorporating snippets from the extensive Time Warner movie library. It's designed to be user-friendly, particularly welcoming to those without extensive programming experience. The entire setup, including the Apple Quadra it operates on, comes to about $15,000 in cost [^1].
