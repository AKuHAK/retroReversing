# Hardware
When announced the PSP was claimed to be as powerful as the PS2 and while it was certainly a very powerful system and the most impressive portable console on the market, it didn't quite reach the performance of it's home console sibling.

The PSP was made up of:
* Dual Core MIPS CPU with SIMD Matrix coprocessor
* GPU with embedded memory (Fixed Function Pipeline)
* Sound processing on second CPU core
