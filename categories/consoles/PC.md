# DOS

## DOS Gaming Aspect Ratio - 320x200
The Youtuber **Displaced Gamers** has an excellent video explaining the common DOS aspect ratio:

# MSX
The MSX was a standard introducted by **Microsoft Japan** to make sure no matter which manufacturer build the PC (e.g Sony, Panasonic, Philips) they would all be able to run the same software.
There were three different revisions of the MSX:
* MSX
* MSX2
* MSX Turbo R

## Introduction to the technology of the MSX
The best video I have found on the MSX is by the Youtuber **Displaced Gamers** where he goes through all the variations of the MSX (MSX2 etc) and explains the hardware limitations and the impressive feats developers managed to accomplish on the systems:

## MSX Games
While the MSX system is most famous for Konami games like Vampire Killer (Castlevania) and Metal Gear there are quite a few games worth playing for the system. What better video to show off the MSX games than the **Game Sack** episode on the topic:
