# Hardware

## Retail Hardware
Rodrigo Copetti has an excellent in-depth article about the hardware architecture of the Nintendo Gamecube, it is a must read for anyone wanting to reverse engineer Gamecube games as you will need to know all about the low level architecture.

# Gamecube Games
The Nintendo Gamecube has an excellent library of games just begging to be reverse engineered, it is always a good idea to do some research before you start, this is where this section comes in as it deals with specific games.

## Games with Debug Symbols
If you are interested in reverse engineering a Gamecube game, the first step is to find out if the game has its **debug symbols** available, this makes it much easier to reverse as all the functions will have nice friendly human readable names.

## Prototype Games
Prototype games are ideal targets for reverse engineering as many of them contain developer information inside them and some games never got a retail release, making them even more interesting!
