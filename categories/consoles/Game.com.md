## Castlevania Symphony of the Night
One of the best games, if not THE best game for the Tiger Game.com was Castlevania SotN but unfortunetly it was cancelled before official retail release. 
Luckily a prototype was dumped in 2022 and it is fully playable. If you are looking for a game to reverse for the Tiger Game.com this one is probably the most interesting!
