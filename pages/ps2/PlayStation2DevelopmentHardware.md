This post covers the hardware used to develop Playstation 2 games by major studios back in the day, for the software side see the post on the Official PS2 SDK.

# Official Development Kit
The official development kit created by Sony was by far the most widley used by game studios for development, however Sony sold a few different devices tailored for different purposes such as programming or QA.

## PlayStation 2 DTL-T10000H Development Tool
The `PlayStation 2 DTL-T10000H Development Tool` or TOOL for short was developed by Sony and sold directly to game studios for game development. 
It connects to a PC workstation and also has the ability to run retail PS2 game discs [^1].

# Third Party Development Kits
Due to the complexity of the PS2 hardware it was not very common for third parties to create development tools for the PS2, however there were a few companies such as SN Systems that created their own cheaper development kits that compete directly with Sony's.

## SN Systems Network Development Kit
One of the development kits that SN Systems created for the Playstation 2 was tailored for games that utilise the Network capabilities that were added towards the end of the PS2's lifetime.
