# Official PSP Development Kit hardware
The hardware supports booting games from both the UMD and DVD drive, the DVD drive can even boot games from standard DVD-R/RW and so many prototype PSP games are actually written on standard rewritable DVDs.

## PSP-1000 Standard Commander Arm
In order to use the DevKit to play games you need a controller, and what better controller than the psp itself! A custom PSP `Controller Arm` was provided with the devkit for such a purpose. It wasn't a real psp and the inside board were very different to a retail psp, it was mainly just an interface for providing button in put and screen output for the developers to see what it would look like on a real psp.
Here is a tear down of the controler hardware by RetroGameTech [^2]:

## PSP Go Commander Arm
When the PSP Go console came out there was an optional accessory for the development kit to switch the standard PSP controller to a version that is basically a PSP-Go shell with all the PSP chips ripped out and it is pretty much just used as a controller and display.
