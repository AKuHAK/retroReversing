The Sony Playstation portable used encrypted executables known as `eboot.bin`, these are basically just an encrypted ELF file and it is possible to decrypt them with the correct tools.

I have never seen a PSP executable that contains the debug symbols inside the elf (eboot) itself, all the games with debug symbols we have come across have been using external .sym and .map files to store the debug information.

# Types of PSP Symbol files

## SYM Symbol Files

.SYM Files are generated by the SN Systems ProDG SDK for PSP for use in debugging, they contain all the symbols (function names etc) and can also contain other chunks such as source filenames and line numbers.

## MAP Symbol Files
Similar to .sym files but are created by the linker to document where each function is located in the final linked executable.

# ViciousEngine
Many games using the ViciousEngine actually came with both the .sym and .map files compressed inside the `DATA.PAK` file.
ViciousEngine was one of the few game engines recommended officially by Sony, and in fact they offered a discount for the engine if it was used to create a PSP Mini [^1].

You can extract the .sym and .map file by opening the `PSP_GAME/USRDIR/DATA.PAK` with 

The `DATA.PAK` file normally contains some files with a name that is a variation of `Game-dvd.map` and `Game-dvd.sym`.
