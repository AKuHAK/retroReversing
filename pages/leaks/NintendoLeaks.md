Nintendo has has many data leaks in the past, but none as huge as the original Oman Archive of the late 90s or the Gigaleaks of 2020. This post is a reference point to help people catch up on any content they might have missed, each leak has its own page with much more detail about the contents of the archives. 

We only list leaks that have development related content, mainly source code as that is the main focus of this site.

# Oman Archive (1999)
The "Oman Archive" was a leak of Nintendo Technical documents from a source inside SGI in late 1999. It was uploaded to the internet under the name `oman.rar` but has since been repackaged into multiple other archive formats.

An updated version of the Oman Archive was released in 2020 at the same time as the Gigaleak, another Nintendo Leak which includes N64 content.

Files Leaked:
* oman.rar

{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/oman-archive" description="For more information on the Oman Archive check out this post." %}

* Gen2.7z

# BroadOn Archive (2nd May 2020)

# Gigaleak (24th July)
On the 24th of July 2020, the mother-load (2GB) was uploaded to a thread on 4chan and was dubbed the  `Gigaleak`. This is a continuation of the leaks that were obtained from a iQue/BroadOn/Routefree hack earlier in the year.

# Gigaleak 2 (25th July)
On the 25th of July 2020, the day after the `Gigaleak`, its sequel Gigaleak 2 was uploaded to a thread on 4chan. This is a continuation of the leaks that were obtained from a iQue/BroadOn/Routefree hack earlier in the year. 

Files Leaked:
* bbgames.7z (just contains bbgames.tar)

# Emerald Leak (2nd September 2020)
The Emerald leak occurred on the 2nd of September 2020 and included about 700MB of content related to the Wii and gamecube. So this would not quite qualify as a "Gigaleak" but it was definitely from the same source as the Gigaleak.

Files Leaked:
* emeralds.7z (742MB)

{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/emeraldleak" description="For more information on the Emerald leak check out this post." %}
