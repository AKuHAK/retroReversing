On the 11th April 2020 the source code to the original generation of Pokemon games was released to 4chan as **osrc.zip**. 
This zip archive contained a password protected zip file called **OriginalSouce.zip** which was quickly cracked and found that the password was **poke1024**.

This post will cover the contents of the leaked source code.
