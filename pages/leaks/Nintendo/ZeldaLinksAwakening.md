 This folder contains the source code for the Japanese version of Links Awakening by **Systems Research and Development** (SRD) where helped Nintendo work on various titles. 

 We are starting with this folder as it seems to be the original and the other folders are just localised changes to the files in this folder, so this is the most important folder in the whole leak.

 When they were preserving the source code to Zelda Links Awakening they used 3 Floppy Disks for the source code and another for the Game Boy SDK and finally one for the documentation and other documents that they decided to call **face**.

### The Old Man with a Beard
The file `MRT.DAT` is a note written by Kazuaki Morita about being an older programmer in the Industry:
> When someone starts fishing, the first catch is said to be a memorable one regardless of its size. Similarly, there are irreplaceable works for game developers. For me, it's Super Mario Bros. 
> The program area was a huge 32 kilobytes at the time, and I think I crammed a lot into it. If there were a few bytes of memory left, there would be an uproar. 
>
> Then there were Mario's infinite replication and the secret world... I think that's when the term "cheat code" started to be used instead of "bug technique."
>It has been about eight years since then, and I have been involved in various works, but as I age, I feel a decrease in my mental agility and memory. 
>
> However, I think I have become more skilled at finding shortcuts. It is often said that a programmer's career lasts until they are 30 years old, but this is a social convention that says "you don't have to program anymore" rather than "you can't program anymore." 
> If I feel like I have reached my limit, I will quit this job, because there is no such thing as a "programmer who doesn't program."
>
> Programmer: Kazuaki Morita

  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 This folder contains all the Software development tools required for original Game Boy development.

  </div>
</section>  


The files in this folder are described in the table below:

File Name | Extension | Description
---|---|---
A | .EXE | DMG Relocatable Macro Assembler Version 1.00
ASMB | .EXE | 6502 Assembler  Version 1.10 (Famicom tool created in 1987)
ASMD | .EXE | DMG Macro Assembler  Version 1.01
ASMDMG | .EXE | DMG Macro Assembler  Version 1.01 (Identical to ASMD.EXE)
CGE2DMG | .EXE | Converts either CGE or DCG Character graphics to source code (.DMG)

ISDMG | .EXE | DMG Relocatable Macro Assembler Version 1.00
ISLINK | .EXE | ISASM Linker  Version 1.00
L | .EXE | ISASM Linker  Version 1.00 (Presumably just copied to have a shorter name)
PW | .EXE | P-ROM Support Program Version 1.26 
PW2 | .EXE, .TB0 | P-ROM Support Program Version 2.02d6
SCR2DMG | .COM | MS-DOS Command File Executable for converting .scr files to .DMG files for assembling
SHL | .COM, .KEY | MS-DOS Command File Executable but not sure what it is for
SHVC | .EXE | SHVC Debugger  Version 1.00a
VRAMTR | .CVT | VRAM Transfer script that converts a .SCR screen file to either a NES or SNES .X65 file
VUP | .EXE | Version UP Program  Version 2.09

**Referenced File Formats**
This SDK seems to use a number of different file formats, but it is not clear what exactly is the purpose of each:
* **.DMG** - Assembly source code for the Dot Matrix Game (Game Boy)
* **.CGE** - Character Graphics data (For famicom?)
* **.DCG** - Character Graphics data (for DMG Game Boy?)
* **.CVT** - Custom Conversion scripts that can be executed with FCV
* **.SCR** - Screen file maybe containing location of character tiles in a level?
* **.X65** - Either Famicom or Super Famicom source code 
* **.COM** - Unsure if this is a Windows Command File or something else

**Famicom SDK Files**
One interesting file is that `HDT.EXE` is included here which is the NES/Famicom Debugger, as far as I know this is the first time a file from the Famicom SDK has ever been leaked. As no other official NES/Famicom SDK had been leaked this is quite remarkable. It was written by Intelligent Systems between 1986-1989 and seems to read in three file formats: CHR (Character/Tile Data), SCR (Screen data? or Source Data?) and CGD (No Idea, maybe Character Graphic Designer?).

**SNES Assembler**
Another interesting file is that `IS65.EXE` is included here which is the Official Super Nintendo Entertainment System assembler created by Intelligent Systems in 1990. It seems to have been written by the developer **Toshio Sengoku**.

The file `VRAMTR.CVT` which is a script in a custom programming langauge that is parsed by the `FCV` program. The comments at the beginning of the file indicate that it takes an input file with a ".SCR" extension and outputs a file with a ".X65" extension.

**File Convert Program**
The File Convert Program (`FCV`) tool was created in 1987 by Intelligent Systems so it is likely it was also part of the Famicom Software Development Kit.

The commands in the script appear to be performing various operations related to transferring data to VRAM. For example, the "VRAD=$2000" command sets the screen address, and the "DTPT=0" command initializes the data pointer. The script also includes commands for writing screen data and attribute data to VRAM.

**Character conversion**
The Bash script `DCGDMG.BAT` is used to convert a file with the extension ".DCG" (presumably containing character graphics) from the FM-R50 system (a Japanese computer system from the 80s) to a source code file with the extension ".DMG". 

The script assumes that the **FM-R50** file is inserted into Drive A of the computer. The script then uses the `FCV` tool to do the conversion.

This potentially means that developers for Nintendo were using the Fujitsu FM-R50 or a compatible system to develop Game Boy games and possibly NES and SNES games too.

### Japan Version 0 Disk 2 (DMG_Zelda_JP_EN/JP_v0_02)
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/JP_v0_02</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 Since this is technically the second version of Disk 2 (with the SPD folder being the first version) we will only cover the changes made from SPD to save re-covering the same files.

  </div>
</section>  


The changes made to this version are mainly small code comment changes and are described in the table below:

File Name | Extension | Changes made comapred to previous version
---|---|---
ZBD | .DMG | Differences to BG Bank Data Comments for: Clerk 1/2, Boomerang, Rotating Turret, Test Marine, Fishing Clerk, Fishes
ZBN | .DMG | Differences to two comments from "使ってねー" to "使ってねーよ" which both mean "Don't use it", the final particle "よ" adds a more forceful tone
ZDB | .DMG | Change to one comment that reads "This is the entrance above! You baldy!" The Baldy part was added as an insult in this version
ZED | .DMG | HART1 was commented out and a few code comments were changed such as saying "Mr. Noto can warp to the opposite platform at the Toba Kaido Station."
ZGD | .DMG | Added a comment to BOMGZ to say "Fold in half to make an even number!"
ZTI | .DMG | Just added a comment that says "Use Shibahara!"
ZVD | .DMG | Just added a comment that says "Nausicaa Leaf"

# その他 - Miscellaneous (/その他)
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/その他</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 "その他" (pronounced "sono ta") is a Japanese phrase that means "other" or "miscellaneous". It is often used to refer to something that does not fit into a specific category or is not included in a list of specified items.

  </div>
</section>  

This folder just contains the following sub-directories:
* **DMGZelda** - Miscellaneous data for the original Game Boy Zelda (Only graphics data)

This folder in turn just contains the following sub-directories:
* **Ver1JP** - Graphics data for Version 1 of the Japanese ROM


---
## Version 1 Japan Graphics Data (/その他/DMGZelda/Ver1JP)
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/Ver1JP</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
This folder just contains the following sub-directories:
* **Character** - Graphics data for Version 1 of the Japanese ROM

 Which in turn just contains graphics data created using the IS-Character development kit which was the official development kit used for graphics development on the original Game Boy.

 All the `.chr` files can be opened in a tool like `Tile Molester` with the Codec set to `2bpp planar` (2-bit per pixel is Game Boy Tile format.)
 
  </div>
</section>  


The files in the **Character** folder are described in the table below:

File Name | Extension | Description
---|---|---
C1 | .CHR | Contains the tiles for the instruments and the numbers 0-9 and others like rupees
C2 | .CHR | Contains the tiles used for the dungeons
C3 | .CHR | Contains tiles but unclear exactly what they are
C4 | .CHR | Contains tiles used for the Title Screen (Japanese)
C5 | .CHR | Contains tiles used in the opening sequence
C6 | .CHR | Contains Non Player Character sprites
C7 | .CHR | Unsure what these tiles are
C8 | .CHR | Contains the tiles spelling out "PLAYER" and what could be water tiles
GAL | .BAT | Windows Batch file for running ?
RZ | .ICE | File is related to the In-Circuit-Emulator used for debugging Game Boy Games seems to contain a list of file names such as BGM_1.HEX

The **GAL.BAT** script which is used for assembling the source code contains the comment "全アセンブル　ハイパ－森田スペシャ－－－－ル　スタ－ト" which roughly translates to "All Assemble! Hyper Morita Special Start!".

This likely means that the script is initiating a build process that is optimized for speed or efficiency, and that it was written by **Kazuaki Morita**.

# CGB.7z Root directory (/CGB.7z)
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/Root Directory</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
When extracted the **CGB.7z** Archive contains two different games, **Zelda DX** and **Hamtaro 2**. Hamtaro 2 isn't related to Zelda and only contains a few pre-build ROM files for various regions (PAL, NTSC, JP).

  </div>
</section>  

This folder contains the following sub-directories:
* **AZL__ゼルダの伝説 夢を見る島DX** - Source code for the Color Game Boy version of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX
* **B86__ハム太郎 2** - Hamtaro 2 Color Game Boy ROMs (no source code)

## Legend of Zelda: Dreaming Island DX (/CGB/AZL__ゼルダの伝説 夢を見る島DX)
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/AZL__ゼルダの伝説 夢を見る島DX</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
The text "/AZL__ゼルダの伝説 夢を見る島DX" is a Japanese text string that roughly translates to "Legend of Zelda: Dreaming Island DX" in English.

Here's a breakdown of the text:

  </div>
</section>  

* "/AZL__" is likely an identifier, maybe Advanced Zelda?
* "ゼルダの伝説" (Zeruda no Densetsu) means "Legend of Zelda."
* "夢を見る島" (Yume wo Miru Shima) means "Dreaming Island."
* "DX" likely stands for "Deluxe," which is a common suffix added to re-releases of games that include additional features or improvements.

修正 | .txt |  "修正.txt" translates to "Correction.txt" which contains a list of Bug Fixes

The `修正.txt` file is interesting as it contains information on a few fixed bugs in the DX version of the game:
>Bug fixes:
>
>In the demo where the fishing shop owner catches the photo shop owner under the bridge, if you press the START button while the photo is being displayed, >the bug that makes it look like you took a picture of the fishing shop owner drowning is fixed.
>→ Commented out the last nine lines of the subroutine "GEKI_8MAIN" in the ZGEKI.s file.
>
>If the number of hearts is greater than the intended number for some reason, the bug fix that causes the game to crash or freeze when you go to the file select screen is fixed.
>→ Added a limit check under the subroutines "HART1ST" and "SVDS010" in the ZTI.s file.
>
>The bug fix for the name registration issue where if the total of the inputted name's character data is 0, you can no longer copy the name.
>→ Changed the addition of numbers in the subroutine "CP3070" in the ZTI.s file to check with an OR command whether the result is 0."

 This folder contains the graphics/tiles created for the Game Boy Color version of Zelda DX. 
    
The Sprite/Tile data created using the IS-Character development kit and are in the .CHR file format used for both NES and Game Boy tiles. In this file format, each tile is represented by an 8x8 pixel matrix, which is stored as a series of 64 bytes. These matrices are then combined to form sprites, backgrounds, and other graphical elements in the game.
    
    Note that these files differ slightly across regions (specifically the title sequence) but most of the tiles are the same across versions. Also these are the same as the DMG tilesets in the DMG.7z leak.
