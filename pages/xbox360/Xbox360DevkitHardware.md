# Xbox 360 Alpha 2 XeDK

<section class="postSection">

 <div markdown="1">
While the image on the left might look like a standard Apple PowerMac G5 it is actually the Xbox 360 Alpha 2 Development Kit!

As this is a development kit created before the final Xbox retail hardware had been finalised it has a few differences and is considerably weaker than what became the retail unit.

The CPU for this unit was only dual core 2GHz compared to the retail units tri core 3.2GHz.

These were used at E3 2005 to showcase the upcoming Xbox 360 games [^1].

One very interesting fact about this unit is that it came with an early build of the Fusion Emulator which played original Xbox games on the 360!
