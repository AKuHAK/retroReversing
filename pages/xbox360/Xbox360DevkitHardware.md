# Xbox 360 Alpha Development Kits
The first development kits for the 360 available were created before the final Xbox retail hardware had been finalised as as such it has a few differences and is considerably weaker than what became the retail unit. There were two Alpha development kits before they moved on to the Beta versions.

## Xbox 360 Alpha 1 XeDK

The image on the left shows a rather large delivery of PowerMac G5s that was delivered to Microsoft! This photo was taken by Michael Hanscom who was a contractor working for the MSCopy print Shop at the time (He was fired for posting this photo to his blog) [^4].

But why would Microsoft buy so many of their competitors flagship product? Well to turn them into Xbox 360 development kits of course!

The Powermac G5 was an ideal candidate for an early Xbox 360 development kit as it uses the same PowerPC chip destined for the Xbox 360, when fitted with the **ATI Radeon 9800 Pro** (128MB) graphics card it turned it from a Mac into a **Xbox 360 Alpha 1 XeDK**.

These were used by only the earliest of 360 game developers and were used between October 2003 and some time in Autumn 2004 [^2].

These development kits used the Original Xbox controllers with a USB connector soldered on to the end instead of the normal xbox connector [^3].

## Xbox 360 Alpha 2 XeDK

While the image on the left might look like a standard Apple PowerMac G5 with an Xbox controller on top, however it is actually the Xbox 360 Alpha 2 Development Kit!

The CPU for this unit was only dual core 2GHz compared to the retail units three cores clocked at **3.2GHz**.

These were used at E3 2005 to showcase the upcoming Xbox 360 games [^1].

One very interesting fact about this unit is that it came with an early build of the Fusion Emulator which played original Xbox games on the 360!
