# Alpha Development Hardware
<section class="postSection">

During the development of the Xbox console, the games aiming to be launch titles required a system to develop for. 

The first development kit that Microsoft sent out to the early developers was the **Alpha I**. 

It has a slower CPU speed (600Mhz) that what became the retail Xbox hardware (733 MHz), however it gave the developers everything they needed to get started with their game.

Later on Microsoft sent out the **Alpha II** development kits which came either as an upgrade for the **Alpha I** unit or pre-built. This new version allowed developers to utilise the full 733 MHz CPU that would be in the retail console.

These Alpha development kits looked like standard PCs at first glance but if you open it up you will find custom parts built specifically for the console [^1]. 

People have attempted to create their own **Frankenstein** versions of these consoles to varying success.
