# Introduction
<section class="postSection">

<div markdown="1">
The Pokemon Reverse Engineering Team (PRET) have managed to pull off a marvellous achievement, they have fully reverse engineered Pokemon Red and Blue back into Z80 assembly code [^1].

The source code they have developed can be assembled back into a 100% identical ROM image as was written to the game cartridges. This opens the door to anyone who ever wondered how these classic games worked, how they were implemented and how to modify them.

With this repository you can do anything you ever dreamed of changing in the original pokemon games, add your own custom pokemon, towns, music, sprites, translations or even modify how the core gameplay works.
