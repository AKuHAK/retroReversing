This post covers all the official hardware developers used to create games for the Gameboy (DMG) and Gameboy Color and some were even used for early Gameboy Advance development.

# Programming Tools
The Official programming development kit for the Gameboy consisted of the Debugger (US$4000) and the Emulator/ICE (US$3000) which were both developed by the Nintendo owned company called Intelligent Systems [^3].

They both connect to a developer workstation such as an IBM-PC via the SCSI port and offer a few software tools for communication between the IBM-PC and the Intelligent systems hardware.

## DMG-ICE (Debugger)
The Integrated Circuit Emulator or ICE was developed for the original Gameboy (DMG) and allowed developers to debug issues effecting their games, set breakpoints and inspect memory.

# Demoing Tools
