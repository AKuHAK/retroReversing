## SEGA Documentary
Around about the time Sonic 3 was near the end of its development.
* Shows assembly code and development kit in part 2.
* Normal PC connected to special cartridge in a normal sgea Genesis allows debugging.
* Video at the end mentions 1993 so I'm presuming thats when the documentary was filmed, but some commenters on Youtube believe it to be 1995. Presumably because its showing in-development games.
