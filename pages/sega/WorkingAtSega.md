## Working At SEGA Documentary
This rare documentary was part of **Careers for the 21st Century** by **Takeoff Multimedia**, it shows what life was like as a developer working at SEGA in 1993. This was probably created to inspire kids to want to get into the games industry, as if children needed more motivation to make games for a living!

The documentary starts with an introduction by **Ron Barber** from Takeoff Multimedia with some rather 90s video effects and acting, it can be quite funny watching it in the present day.

Interview with Roger hector who was VP of the SEGA Techincal Institute at the time claiming that talented game developers are like "Rockstars" and can make quite a bit of money. In fact they even go as far as to use the phrase "License to Print Money" and compare it to the successful career of Bill Cosby... (Doesn't age well).

This was around the time that Sonic 3 was near the end of its development.

* Shows assembly code and development kit in part 2.
* Video at the end mentions 1993 so I'm presuming thats when the documentary was filmed, but some commenters on Youtube believe it to be 1995. Presumably because its showing in-development games.
* Dean Ruggles - Animator at SEGA Technical Institute ( working on Comix Zone animation)
  - Which Software is he using?
* Adrian Stevens - Technical Director
  - What development kit is he using?
  - Normal PC connected to special cartridge in a normal sgea Genesis allows debugging.
  - Demonstrates being able to pause and step through the game using the debugger on the pc.
