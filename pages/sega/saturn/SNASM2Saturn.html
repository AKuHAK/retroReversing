# Develop Games on Saturn with SNASM2

There was an advert in the Uk magazine `EDGE` issue 21 that took the space theme of the saturn and ran with it:
<img src="/public/magazine/SNASM2.Saturn.EDGE.N021.1995.06.jpg" />

According the to advert it was a pretty advanced game development kit back in 1995:
```
SNASM2 can give you the edge! 
The preferred development system of SEGA Worldwide, 
SNASM2 Saturn provides full C Source level debugging, 
C-Structure browse facility, 
and local variable windows, 
along with support for user breakpoint controller in SH2s.
```
