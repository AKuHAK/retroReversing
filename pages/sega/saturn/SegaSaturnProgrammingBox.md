## Sega Saturn Programming Box (Sophia Systems)

Acording to SegaRetro.org the programming box was released before the saturn so would only be used for early titles (that started developed before mid-1995):
```
The Sega Saturn Programming Box is a development kit for the Sega Saturn, released by Sophia Systems. 
These are the "old" Saturn devkits (pre-dating consumer Saturn hardware) and were replaced in mid-1995 by Sega of America's CartDev.
```
