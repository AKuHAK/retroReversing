During the sega saturns lifecycle there were multiple development kits available to developers starting from the original Sphia Systems that came out befoe the retail hardware, followed by devkits from both `Cross Products` and `SN Systems (PSYQ)`.

Acording to SegaRetro.org the programming box was released before the saturn so would only be used for early titles (that started developed before mid-1995):

> The Sega Saturn Programming Box is a development kit for the Sega Saturn, released by Sophia Systems. 
> These are the "old" Saturn devkits (pre-dating consumer Saturn hardware) and were replaced in mid-1995 by Sega of America's CartDev. [^1]
