# Code Formats

## Executables (COF)
Sega Saturn Executables are actually COF/COFF (Common Object File Format) files which is a precursor to the ELF executable format that is used on most future console platforms.

## ABS files
ABS files seem to be the output of the LNK command and are specified in `.lnk` makefiles. Each sample in the SDK builds an ABS file along with the COFF executable. They both seem to be a collection of object libraries (assembled code) but not sure the difference between the formats.

Sometimes these are listed as "Execution files" so I am not sure if cof is the default executable format or not anymore.

ABS Files are listed in the documentation as "Absolute load module file "

# Video Formats

## CPK
```
Many Sega Saturn CD-ROM games use this file format to store frames of a Cinepak-compressed video interleaved with uncompressed PCM audio. When this is the case, the files will typically have the extension .CPK (which is why FILM files are usually known as CPK files). Sometimes, audio-only FILM files will have a .SND extension.
