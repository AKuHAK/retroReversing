# Introduction
In 2020 and 2021 numerous secret files have been leaked from Nintendo thanks to Zammis Clark. Included in these files were documentation and source code for an unreleased console for the Chinese market with the codename **BB2**. 

This is a sequel to the Nintendo 64 Based **iQue Player** that was released in China successfully.

This post will cover the **bb2.7z** archive leaked in July 2021.

#  iQue Gamecube Documentation (bb2.7z/doc)

  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/doc</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 This folder contains leaked documents relating to the sequel to the Chinese iQue Player which plays N64 games and had the codename **BB**. 

Most of the implementation was completed by the Chinese company **BroadOn**, in fact it was almost ready for release, however it never made it to market.

The root folder contains an index.html file which can be opened in any webbrowser and gives links to all the internal sites related to BB2 such as the source code archive.

This folder also contains the following sub-directories:
* **ali** - Documentation about the Multimedia System on a Chip designed by T-Squares/ALi for use in the BB2 hardware
* **dv** - Design Validation documentation
* **dvd** - 
* **gamecube** - 
* **hardware** - 
* **infrastructure** - 
* **licensing** - Document outlining the costs of licensing DVD playback functionality for BB2
* **marketing** - Contains a really interesting Market Analysis by BroadOn and proposal for why BB2 will be a success (Games + DVD + karaoke)
* **online** - Documentation related to Online Gaming!
* **schedules** - 
* **security** - 
* **system_hw** - 
* **system_software** -

## Ali Multimedia Engine SOC (/ali)
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/ali</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 This folder contains documentation related to the low level hardware for the Multimedia processor designed by T-Square Design (ALi) for use in project BB2.

ALi Corporation bought **T-Square Design** some time in 2004 and re-branded everything under their brand, so in some files you will see T-Squared and in newer files you will see ALi.

The company T-Square design (Also known as T2Design in the documentation) designed the **T630x** range of Multimedia System on A chip (SOC) but when they were bought by ALi they renamed this range to the **M630x** range.

The newer chips in the range were later named as the **335X** causing even more confusing, you will find documentation about all the different chips in this folder, but the main thing to remember is that they the resulting BB2 SOC contains features from all of them.

Ali Family of  **Networked DVD Multimedia Processor** chips:
* 6303/6304/6305/6306 - 2003 and earlier designed by T2-design
* 3355/3357 - 2003 newer versions of 630X range
* 3358 - The BB2 chip requested in 2004

The BB2 project initially choose to base the system on the **M3357** clocked as 200MHZ with MPEG 1,2,4 support, a PCI interface and hardware Variable Length Decoding (VLD).

In 2004 they requested the **M3358** which is a custom version of the **M3357** with a few changes such as a 32bit SDRAM width instead of 16bit width.

The SOC provides functionality for Audio (DSP) and Graphics (Display Engine) along with DVD playback, MP3 playback and Networking. It does this with a in-built  MIPS32 RISC-based CPU and a Digital Signal Processor (DSP).

The Display Engine (DE) supports both PAL and NTSC along with both interlaced and progressive scan modes! The Display Engine is split into two main parts the Video Post Processor (VPOST) and the Digital Video Interface (DVI).
