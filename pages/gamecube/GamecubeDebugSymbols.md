Gamecube game executable can come in a number of different formats, one is the standard .DOL file (short for dolphin) and the other is the ELF.



# ELF Files

ELF files can contain many debug symbols such as the function, variable and sometimes even file names.

You can normally see the symbols by opening in a dissasembler such as Radare2 or IDA Pro.
