All thanks to BullyWiiPlaza on youtube for searching through all their Wii eShop games to find the unstripped binaries [^1].

Unless I am mistaken the code shown in the video seems to just load a pre-existing list of IDs that are known un-stripped binaries and is not actually searching through a hard drive of games. Where did the original list of IDs come from?
Reference to Maschell who does a lot of WiiU homebrew coding on github, he could be the original source.
