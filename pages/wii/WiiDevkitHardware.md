# Wii Prototype Development Kit
<section class="postSection">

The first development kit available for the Wii was actually just a Gamecube with motion controllers!

In fact it was the green gamecube development unit called the **NR Reader**. This allowed developers to write games to writeable NR-discs and test the game out on the read hardware.

You will notice that the motion controller actually plugs into the standard gamecube controller port and so is not wireless and it comes with a slightly different motion bar than the retail units.

You can read more about the NR Reader and other Gamecube development kit hardware on its own page.
