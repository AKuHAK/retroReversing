# Official Development kits
This section will cover the official development kit hardware sold by Nintendo and developed by **Intelligent Systems**.

The Nintendo DS was codenamed **NITRO** during development which is why most of the development kits have the prefix **IS-NITRO** (IS is for Intelligent Systems).

The first ever Nintendo DS development kit simply consisted of two GBA screens connected with a custom SNES-like controller. The image on the left is the unit that Nintendo gave to **Alpha Dream** very early in the DS lifecycle so that they would work on **Partners in Time**.
