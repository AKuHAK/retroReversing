# Official Development kits
This section will cover the official development kit hardware sold by Nintendo and developed by **Intelligent Systems**.

The Nintendo DS was initially codenamed **IRIS** during development and this later changed to **NITRO** which is why most of the development kits have the prefix **IS-NITRO** (IS is for Intelligent Systems).

## Prototype Development Kit
<section class="postSection">

 <div markdown="1">
The first ever Nintendo DS development kit simply consisted of two GBA screens connected with a custom SNES-like controller. The image on the left is the unit that Nintendo gave to **Alpha Dream** very early in the DS lifecycle so that they would work on **Partners in Time**.

## IS-NITRO-Emulator
<section class="postSection">

 <div markdown="1">
The Nintendo GameBoy has the IS-DMG-Emulator, the GameBoy Advance has the **IS-AGB-Emulator** and thus the DS/NITRO required its own **IS-NITRO-EMULATOR**.

This piece of hardware has a GBA slot but does not allow playing of retail games. 
Some models support Video Out to allow gameplay to be shown on a much larger screen that the DS.

The video on the left by Hard4Games shows off the hardware in great detail [^1].

### IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER
<section class="postSection">

 <div markdown="1">
Similar to the **IS-NITRO-EMULATOR** the **IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER** was an advanced version which added a few debugging features such as breakpoints and memory watchers to the emulator.

## IS-NITRO-Capture
<section class="postSection">

<iframe class="wow slideInLeft postImage"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh9pHzKFXE4" height="300" title="Nintendo DS on your television, the IS-Nitro-Capture a developers tool" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

 <div markdown="1">
The **IS-NITRO-Capture** is hardware that can play DS and GBA games on a PC or TV. This is very useful for QA teams to avoid eye strain and for Game journalists to take screenshots of Nintendo DS games.

Note that it did not support original GB and GBC games unlike the retail Nintendo DS [^2].
