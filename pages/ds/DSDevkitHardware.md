# Official Development kits
This section will cover the official development kit hardware sold by Nintendo and developed by **Intelligent Systems**.

The Nintendo DS was codenamed **NITRO** during development which is why most of the development kits have the prefix **IS-NITRO** (IS is for Intelligent Systems).

## Prototype Development Kit

 <div markdown="1">
The first ever Nintendo DS development kit simply consisted of two GBA screens connected with a custom SNES-like controller. The image on the left is the unit that Nintendo gave to **Alpha Dream** very early in the DS lifecycle so that they would work on **Partners in Time**.

## IS-NITRO-Emulator
<section class="postSection">

 <div markdown="1">
The Nintendo GameBoy has the IS-DMG-Emulator, the GameBoy Advance has the **IS-AGB-Emulator** and thus the DS/NITRO required its own **IS-NITRO-EMULATOR**.

This piece of hardware has a GBA slot but does not allow playing of retail games. 
Some models support Video Out to allow gameplay to be shown on a much larger screen that the DS.

The video on the left by Hard4Games shows off the hardware in great detail [^1].
