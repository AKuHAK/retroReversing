On the 25th of July 2020, the day after the `Gigaleak`, its sequel Gigaleak 2 was uploaded to a thread on 4chan. This is a continuation of the leaks that were obtained from a iQue/BroadOn/Routefree hack earlier in the year.

# Uploaded Files
This leak contained files for a Version Control Repository (CVS) owned by the creators of the Chinese iQue Player (Routefree). It mainly focussed on Nintendo 64 source code but also contained a few Gameboy Advance (AGB) files too. Note that this was sent from Nintendo to iQue for the purpose of creating a Chinese localised version of the main N64 games such as:
* 1080 snowboarding
* Animal Crossing/Forest
* Super Mario 64
* Mario Kart 64
* Wave Race 64
* Zelda (MM & OOT).

Files Leaked:
* bbgames.7z (just contains bbgames.tar)

## Step 1 - Extracting the tar
The first step after extracting the 7Zip file to to extract the tar archive, you can do this like so:
```bash
tarÂ -xvf bbgames.tar
```
If you get an error such as "Cannot open: Invalid argument" it is due to some of the file names containing characters that are invalid on a FAT* based File System. So you will need to extract on a different file system such as NTSC [^1].

## Step 2 - Installing CVS and checking out files
You will need to first have the CVS command line utilities installed if you haven't already then you can install like so:
* Mac OSX: `brew install cvs`
* Ubuntu Linux: `apt-get install cvs`

Now run the command in a folder that you want to extract the files:
```bash
cvs -d path/to/download/d1/routefree/bbgames/depot checkout .
```

It is a very large repository so expect it to take a while to complete.
