# N64 Prototype Cartridge Information

These were most likely given out to journalists to preview/review the games in their magazines before the official launch of the game.

They are double the size of regular N64 games and they are actually re-writeable using a flashing device by Intelligent systems.

These Flash Card writers can write up to 7 cards at a time! I wonder how long it took to write each card.

A video with more information is available here:
