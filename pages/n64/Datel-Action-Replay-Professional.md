# Datel Action Replay Professional

## V-Ram functionality

You could press a "Freeze button" on the Action Replay to “see images not normally visible during playing of the game”. The video seems to be showing different render frames from the game Top Gear Overdrive.

Not sure why this would be useful apart from taking screenshots for magazines or just to see inside the renderer.
