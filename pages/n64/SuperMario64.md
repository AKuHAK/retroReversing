<div markdown="1">
The Game was made by Nintendo EAD and was released in Europe on March 1st, 1997. 
The development team consisted of 2 System programmers and 3 main programmers with additions from `Giles Goddard` responsible for the Mario face at the beginning and `Takumi Kawagoe` responsible for the camera programming [^1].

The source code is almost completely written in C and compiled with IDO C compiler 5.3.

You can use the program called "Toad's Tool" to edit the 3D worlds for the game Mario 64. Itâ€™s quite a simple tool, it allows you to view each world and edit the x,y,z coordinates of each object.

Also contains basic functionality for texture editing.

# Decompilation
Super Mario 64 was blown wide open when a full decompilation of the source code was acheived by a team of talented individuals.

The project can be rebuilt with the correct version of the IDO C compiler through QEMU-IRIX to produce a byte-identical ROM of the retail game for both North America and Japan. 

This allows anyone with basic c-knowledge to hack around and change core gameplay elements, make the game easier/harder/add new mechanics etc.

## Introduction to the Decompilation project
Mountainflaw has released a tutorial that covers the basics of the Decompilation project and is the best way to get started for newcomers:
[Introduction to Super Mario64 Decomp](https://mountainflaw.github.io/assets/page/intro.html)

## Checking out the Code
The project is released on Github: [GitHub - n64decomp/sm64: A Super Mario 64 decompilation, brought to you by a bunch of clever folks.](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) and can be built on linux and windows but for mac you will need to use something like docker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64.git
```
