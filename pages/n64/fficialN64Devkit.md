# SGI Onyx N64 Early Development Hardware
In the very early days of the Ultra 64 project the retail hardware was still under active development, but games would need to start development as soon as possible so that the system could have launch titles.

As there was no ready hardware to use early developers for the platform used the `SGI Onyx` as it was presumed that the hardware would be very similar, they were envisioning the N64 as just a stripped down version of this workstation, mainly due to their partnership with SGI for the graphics.

The earliest mention of the SGI Onyx being used as an early development kit for the Nintendo 64  was in the Edge UK magazine issue 20 from May 1995. [^1].

# Official Sound Development Tools
Nintendo released multiple hardware for Sound designers to test their creations on the real hardware without having to bug the developers to borrow a full development machine.

The SDK also came with the `N64 Sound Tools` and `MusyX Audio Tools` which contain software such as a sound sample editor which used a format similar to MIDI [^2].

## NUS-SUD

Gerry_MAN has taken some excellent photos of his NUS-SUD on Twitter along with photos of him actually managing to connect and send data from his PC to the hardware!

## Full Devkit used by Sound designers 
The full n64 development kit was used by Sound designer Grant Kirkhope at Rare to produce masterpieces such as Banjo-Kazooie and GoldenEye. This consisted of a Silicon Graphics Indy with the N64 hardware used as an extension inside it [^2].
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmmm I donâ€™t think I did. I had a Silicon Graphics Indy computer with the Ultra 64 circuit board inside it. I connected my PC to it via midi</p>&mdash; Grantilda Von Scarehope (@grantkirkhope) <a href="https://twitter.com/grantkirkhope/status/1182160711377506304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
