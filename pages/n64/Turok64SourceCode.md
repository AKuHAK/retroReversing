# Introduction to Turok 64

Game was made by Iguana Entertainment under Acclaim and released on March 4th 1997. The development team consisted of 9 programmers under the lead of Rob Cohen, 22 artists under the direction of Creative Director Nigel Cook, which made a team of over 61 people when you include all the other specialties[^3]. 

# Cartridge

The Game was pressed on to [8] megabyte cartridges meaning assets needed to be compressed or cut in order to fit everything on the cartridge. The game was developed on SGI Indy workstations  with special Nintendo 64 (ultra64 at the time) hardware on a board the plugged straight into the SGI Expansion slot. This allowed developers to test games quickly without having to write a development cartridge every time [^2].
