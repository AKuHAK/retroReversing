# Mario Kart 64 World Viewer

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/0pZkOKRfCUlcJDX5TiJL8g_img_0.png)

This is a very cool tool, it actually allows you to see the tracks from Mario Kart 64 in your web browser! I wish more tools were developed as client side web apps as they are much more cross-platform friendly and don't require the hassle of download/dependencies etc.

The project also contains documentation for the Mario Kart 64 rom file, specifying key addresses of track and texture information. Very useful for anyone wanting to create their own tracks for this classic game!

You can view the project and even download the source code on github:
