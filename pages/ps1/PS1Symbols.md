I have never seen a PS1 executable bigger than 2mb, normally if they require more code they split it into multiple executables. 
With memory being so precious it would be unlikely a developer would forget to strip the debug symbols from an executable. 
However it is possible to find symbols included on the disk in various formats, one of those formats is SYM:
* CyberTiger has GOLF.SYM
* BrunswickCircuitProBowling has THQB2.SYM
* Chill (Europe) seems to have lots of source code in it! incide CDFILLER, includes C files!! Might just be the names of the files thoâ€¦
* Digimon World contains quite a lot of what look like symbols in MOV_REL.BIN
* Disneys 101 Dalmarions Patches London contains MAIN.SYM also MAIN.MAP!!! that can be used to put symbols back in game
* DivideThe EnemiesWithin contains GAME.SYM and looks like it uses C++!
* DoraTheExplorer has MAIN.SYM
* Frogger2 seems to contain Makefiles
* JackieChanStuntmaster contains GAME_REL.SYM!!!
* KnockoutKings contains MAIN.MAP with address name mapping

These ones crashed while getting contents:
* CastrolHondaSuperbikeRacing - BIKE.SYM

Other Interesting:
* Disney GoofysFunHouse contains string - "dbugpsx /h /epsx.cpe /m-  psx.sym"
