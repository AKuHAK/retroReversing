These boards were originally sold only to licensed developers only. 

However, there was a consumer version of a similar device called Net Yaroze which is basically just like a stock PlayStation but the console is painted in Matte Black and comes with a serial link cable to connect the console to your PC and a stripped down version of the PlayStation SDK as well as documentation. 

It was sold mostly to hobbyist programmers as the only way to acquire it was by ordering it through Sony's PlayStation website back in the day... With a hefty price tag of course.

Original Prototype PS1 given to only a few developers called MW.3:

# Twin ISA Development Kit:

# CD Emulator Card
```				
This enabled the company to design a CD emulator card which connected to a hard drive and output a steady data stream equivalent to that from the CD drive. Now PlayStation	
code could be written and tested under simulation without having to repeatedly cut expensive gold COs (requiring a specialist Sony machine costing Â£4000).

# Blue Debugging Playstation
```		
However, the few di erences between the development kit and a production Playstation mean that final testing is done on a blue debugging PlayStation - this is the closest it gets to running on a production console before the complete game is submitted to Sony for duplication.

# PSY-Q PlayStation Plug-in
To go along with the PC based development environment, SN Systems also developed a custom plugin for the back of the playstation debug unit. This turns the debug unit into a full development environment!
