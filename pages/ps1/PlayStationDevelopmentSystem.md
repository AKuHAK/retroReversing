These boards were originally sold only to licensed developers only. 

However, there was a consumer version of a similar device called Net Yaroze which is basically just like a stock PlayStation but the console is painted in Matte Black and comes with a serial link cable to connect the console to your PC and a stripped down version of the PlayStation SDK as well as documentation. 

It was sold mostly to hobbyist programmers as the only way to acquire it was by ordering it through Sony's PlayStation website back in the day... With a hefty price tag of course.ï»¿
Just a quickly put together video demonstrating my rare DTL-H2000 development board set used to develop games for the Sony PlayStation which I received last month
