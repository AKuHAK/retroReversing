# DTL-H2000
The video above shows the DTL-H2000 Development unit which slots into the ISA slot of a PC and contains all the hardware on a retail PS1.
These boards were originally sold only to licensed developers only. 

# MW.3 (Original Prototype Playstation)
Original Prototype PS1 given to only a few developers called MW.3:

# CD Emulator Card
```				
This enabled the company to design a CD emulator card which connected to a hard drive and output a steady data stream equivalent to that from the CD drive. Now PlayStation	
code could be written and tested under simulation without having to repeatedly cut expensive gold COs (requiring a specialist Sony machine costing Â£4000). 
```

# Blue Debugging Playstation
```		
However, the few di erences between the development kit and a production Playstation mean that final testing is done on a blue debugging PlayStation - this is the closest it gets to running on a production console before the complete game is submitted to Sony for duplication.  
```

# PSY-Q PlayStation Plug-in
To go along with the PC based development environment, SN Systems also developed a custom plugin for the back of the playstation debug unit. This turns the debug unit into a full development environment!
