The Playstation One was not only Sony's first commercial video games console it was also the most popular console of its generation. The PS1 was competing against both the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn during its lifetime and in some respects was the underdog in terms of processing power and graphics. However don't be disillusioned the PS1 was still a very powerful machine for its time and when programmed correctly games could look stunning, sometimes even better than the Nintendo 64!

The Hardware initially looks quite clean and simple, especially in comparison to other consoles of its generation, but it still managed to pack a lot of power on to its small design.
