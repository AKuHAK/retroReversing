# 32-bit compilers using Wine
You can run the 32-bit compilers built for windows through WINE on Mac and Linux.

# 16-bit compilers using DOSBox
If you can't get the 32-bit compilers to work there is another option, the PSYQ SDK comes with 16-bit versions of the compilers built for DOS that we can emulate in DOSBOX.
The 16-bit executables are located in the psyq folder which is located at the same level as the bin directory.
