Some game developers prefer to use their own in-house game engine rather than use an off-the-shelf game engine such as Unity or Unreal.  This page will cover some of the most used custom engines and the details we know about them.

# Shin'en Multimedia Custom Engine (The C Engine)
Used by `Shin'en Multimedia` for the following wiiU games:
